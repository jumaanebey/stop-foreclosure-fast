## My Foreclosure Solution Launches Free Foreclosure Survival Guide as California Filings Surge Past 367,000

*Licensed real estate professionals release 12-page emergency action plan for homeowners facing foreclosure across all 58 California counties*

**CALIFORNIA — February 2026** — As California foreclosure filings surpass 367,000 properties — marking 11 consecutive months of year-over-year increases — My Foreclosure Solution has released a free 12-page Foreclosure Survival Guide designed to help homeowners take immediate action to protect their homes and equity.

The guide, available for instant download at https://myforeclosuresolution.com/free-guide.html, covers emergency timelines, lender negotiation scripts, California-specific legal protections under the Homeowner Bill of Rights, and equity preservation strategies.

"Most homeowners don't realize they still have options after receiving a Notice of Default," said the founder of My Foreclosure Solution. "California law provides significant protections that many families never learn about until it's too late. We created this guide so homeowners can take the right steps in the critical first 7 days."

### The Guide Covers:

- **Day-by-day emergency action plan** for the first week after a foreclosure notice
- **Word-for-word scripts** for calling lenders and servicers
- **California Homeowner Bill of Rights** protections most families don't know about
- **5 proven alternatives** to foreclosure, including loan modification, forbearance, short sale, and cash offers
- **Equity protection strategies** to prevent unnecessary financial loss
- **Warning signs of foreclosure rescue scams** and how to verify legitimate help

### A Growing Crisis

According to ATTOM Data Solutions, California remains among the states with the highest foreclosure activity in the nation. Filings have increased steadily since early 2025, with Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Sacramento counties seeing some of the sharpest rises.

The California Attorney General's office has also warned of a spike in foreclosure rescue scams targeting vulnerable homeowners, including fraudulent title transfer schemes and phantom help operations that charge fees for services never delivered.

"Homeowners in crisis are prime targets for scammers," the founder added. "That's why we provide free consultations with no fees and no pressure. We're licensed real estate professionals — DRE #02076038 and NMLS #2033637 — and we believe every family deserves honest guidance."
