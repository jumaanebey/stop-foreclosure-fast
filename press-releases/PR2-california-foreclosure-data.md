## California Foreclosure Filings Hit 11-Month Growth Streak: Local Expert Urges Homeowners to Act Early

*My Foreclosure Solution reports surge in consultation requests as Riverside, San Bernardino, and Sacramento counties see steepest filing increases*

**CALIFORNIA — March 2026** — California's foreclosure crisis continues to deepen as ATTOM Data Solutions reports 11 consecutive months of year-over-year increases in foreclosure filings statewide. With more than 367,000 properties receiving foreclosure-related notices in the past year, licensed real estate professional and My Foreclosure Solution founder is urging homeowners to explore their options before reaching the point of no return.

"The biggest mistake homeowners make is waiting," said the founder of My Foreclosure Solution. "By the time most families call us, they've already lost weeks or months of time that could have been spent pursuing a loan modification, forbearance plan, or other alternative. California's foreclosure timeline moves faster than people think."

### California by the Numbers

- **367,000+** properties received foreclosure filings statewide in the past 12 months
- **11 consecutive months** of year-over-year increases in filing activity
- **Los Angeles County** continues to lead the state in total filings
- **Riverside and San Bernardino counties** have seen some of the largest percentage increases
- **Sacramento and Fresno counties** are emerging as new hotspots for foreclosure activity

### Why the Surge?

Industry analysts point to several converging factors driving the increase:

- **Expiration of pandemic-era protections** — forbearance agreements and moratoriums that shielded millions of homeowners have fully expired
- **Rising interest rates** — homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages are seeing monthly payments increase by hundreds or even thousands of dollars
- **Insurance costs** — California homeowners insurance premiums have skyrocketed, adding to monthly housing costs
- **Cost of living pressure** — inflation in groceries, gas, and utilities has stretched household budgets to the breaking point

### What Homeowners Should Know

My Foreclosure Solution outlines five critical steps for any California homeowner who has missed a payment or received a foreclosure notice:

1. **Don't ignore the mail.** Every notice has a deadline attached to it.
2. **Call your lender immediately.** Ask about loss mitigation options before the process advances.
3. **Know your rights.** California's Homeowner Bill of Rights requires lenders to consider alternatives before proceeding to sale.
4. **Get a free consultation.** A licensed professional can evaluate your situation and outline every available option.
5. **Beware of scams.** Never sign over your title or pay upfront fees to anyone promising to "save" your home.

"We offer free consultations to homeowners anywhere in California — no fees, no obligation," the founder said. "Sometimes the best option is a loan modification. Sometimes it's a short sale or a cash offer. But you can't make the right decision if you don't know all your options."
