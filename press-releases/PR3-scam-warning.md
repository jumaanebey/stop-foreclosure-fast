## Foreclosure Rescue Scams Surge in California: Licensed Professionals Warn Homeowners to Verify Before Trusting

*My Foreclosure Solution releases scam identification checklist as Attorney General reports rise in fraudulent title transfers and phantom help schemes*

**CALIFORNIA — March 2026** — As California foreclosure filings continue climbing, a parallel crisis is unfolding: the return of foreclosure rescue scams. My Foreclosure Solution, a licensed California real estate firm, is warning homeowners to verify credentials and watch for red flags before trusting anyone who claims they can stop a foreclosure.

"Every time foreclosure rates go up, the scammers come out," said the founder of My Foreclosure Solution. "We're hearing from homeowners who've been approached by companies demanding thousands of dollars upfront, or worse — asking them to sign over the title to their home. These are not legitimate operations."

### The Most Common Foreclosure Scams in California

The California Attorney General's office and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) have identified several schemes currently targeting homeowners:

**1. Title Transfer / Deed Theft**
Scammers convince homeowners to sign over their property deed with promises of lease-back arrangements or guaranteed loan modifications. Once the title transfers, the homeowner loses all ownership rights and equity.

**2. Phantom Help Scams**
Fake "foreclosure consultants" charge fees of $1,000 to $5,000 or more for services they never deliver — and often tell homeowners to stop communicating with their lender, causing the foreclosure to accelerate.

**3. Equity Skimming**
A buyer offers to take over mortgage payments and "save" the home, then collects rent without making payments. The original homeowner's credit is destroyed when the lender forecloses.

**4. Bait-and-Switch Refinancing**
Homeowners believe they're signing loan modification paperwork, but the documents actually refinance the home at predatory terms — often with balloon payments or interest rates that make default inevitable.

**5. Senior Targeting**
Elderly homeowners with significant equity are specifically targeted through door-to-door visits, unsolicited phone calls, and mailers designed to look like government notices.

### How to Verify Legitimate Help

My Foreclosure Solution recommends homeowners take these steps before working with any foreclosure assistance company:

- **Check their license.** California law requires real estate professionals to hold a DRE license. Verify at the California Bureau of Real Estate: https://www.dre.ca.gov
- **Never pay upfront fees.** California Civil Code Section 2945 makes it illegal for foreclosure consultants to collect fees before services are fully performed.
- **Never sign over your title.** No legitimate foreclosure assistance requires you to transfer ownership of your home.
- **Get a second opinion.** HUD-approved housing counselors provide free advice: 1-800-569-4287
- **Trust your instincts.** If someone pressures you to act immediately or says "don't talk to your lender," walk away.

"We provide free consultations because homeowners in crisis shouldn't have to pay just to understand their options," the founder said. "We're licensed — DRE #02076038 and NMLS #2033637 — and anyone can verify that in 30 seconds on the state's website. If a company won't give you a license number, that's your first red flag."
