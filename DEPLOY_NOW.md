# üöÄ DEPLOY YOUR AI NOW - EXACT COMMANDS

Copy and paste these commands in your terminal to deploy your AI system:

## STEP 1: Navigate to AI Directory
```bash
cd ~/Documents/stop-foreclosure-fast/python-enhancements
```

## STEP 2: Run Deployment Script
```bash
./deploy-to-cloudrun.sh
```

**The script will:**
1. ‚úÖ Authenticate with Google Cloud (opens browser)
2. ‚úÖ Create a new Google Cloud project
3. ‚úÖ Enable required APIs
4. ‚úÖ Build your AI container
5. ‚úÖ Deploy to Cloud Run
6. ‚úÖ Give you the live API URL

## STEP 3: What You'll See

The script will ask:
- **Authenticate?** ‚Üí Click "Allow" in browser
- **Create project?** ‚Üí Press Enter (uses default name)
- **Enable APIs?** ‚Üí Press Enter (enables automatically)
- **Deploy?** ‚Üí Press Enter (deploys your AI)

## STEP 4: Get Your AI URL

After deployment, you'll see:
```
üéâ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!
üìç Your AI API is live at: https://foreclosure-ai-xxx.run.app
```

**Copy this URL** - you'll need it for the next step!

## STEP 5: Update Website Integration

1. **Edit ai-integration.js** (line 8):
   ```javascript
   // Replace this line:
   const AI_API_URL = 'https://your-ai-service-url.run.app';
   
   // With your actual URL:
   const AI_API_URL = 'https://foreclosure-ai-xxx.run.app';
   ```

2. **Upload to your website** following the instructions in:
   `HOSTINGER_UPLOAD_PACKAGE/README_UPLOAD_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## EXPECTED TIMELINE:
- **Authentication:** 1 minute
- **Project creation:** 2 minutes  
- **API enablement:** 1 minute
- **Container build:** 5-7 minutes
- **Deployment:** 1 minute
- **Total time:** 10-12 minutes

## IF YOU GET STUCK:

**Authentication Issues:**
- Make sure you're using the same Google account
- Try running: `gcloud auth login` separately first

**Permission Issues:**
- The script might ask for billing account setup
- Google Cloud's free tier doesn't require a credit card
- Just follow the prompts to enable free tier

**Build Issues:**
- Make sure you're in the right directory
- Try: `ls` and you should see `deploy-to-cloudrun.sh`

## WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:

After deployment:
1. ‚úÖ Your AI runs on Google's servers (FREE)
2. ‚úÖ You get a live API URL
3. ‚úÖ Update your website files with the URL
4. ‚úÖ Upload enhanced files to Hostinger
5. ‚úÖ Your website has enterprise AI capabilities!
