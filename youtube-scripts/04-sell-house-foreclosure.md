## HOOK (0:00-0:05)

**[On camera, confident]**

"Think you can't sell your house because you're in foreclosure? That's one of the biggest myths I hear. Let me tell you the truth."

**[B-ROLL: "SOLD" sign, happy homeowner]**

## INTRO (0:05-0:40)

**[On camera]**

"I'm [Name] from My Foreclosure Solution, and I talk to homeowners every single day who believe they're trapped. They think because they got a Notice of Default, because the foreclosure process has started, they've lost all control.

That's simply not true.

Here's the reality: in California, you can absolutely sell your home during foreclosure. In fact, for many homeowners, it's the BEST option available. You can pay off your mortgage, stop the foreclosure, and often walk away with money in your pocket.

Let me explain exactly how this works."

## MYTH-BUSTING: WHY PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN'T SELL (0:40-1:30)

**[On camera]**

"First, let's bust some myths, because I hear these all the time.

**[GRAPHIC: "MYTH #1" appears]**

Myth number one: 'The bank owns my house now.'

No, they don't. Not until that foreclosure auction happens and someone else buys it. Until then, YOU are still the owner. You still have the right to sell.

**[GRAPHIC: "MYTH #2" appears]**

Myth number two: 'No one will buy a house in foreclosure.'

Wrong again. Buyers purchase homes in foreclosure all the time. Many don't even know or care about your mortgage situation. They just want the house.

**[B-ROLL: Happy couple looking at house, real estate transaction]**

**[GRAPHIC: "MYTH #3" appears]**

Myth number three: 'I'm underwater, so I can't sell.'

Even if you owe more than your home is worth, you might still be able to sell through a short sale. That's where the bank agrees to accept less than what's owed. Is it ideal? No. But it's way better than a foreclosure on your record.

The bottom line: until that auction gavel falls, selling is absolutely an option."

## HOW SELLING DURING FORECLOSURE WORKS (1:30-2:45)

**[On camera with step graphic]**

"Okay, so how does this actually work? Let me walk you through it.

**[GRAPHIC: "Step 1: Determine Your Equity"]**

Step one: Figure out how much equity you have. Take your home's current market value and subtract what you owe on your mortgage. That's your equity.

And here's some good news for California homeowners: property values have increased significantly over the past few years. Many people have way more equity than they realize.

**[B-ROLL: Home value charts going up, California homes]**

**[GRAPHIC: "Step 2: List Your Home"]**

Step two: List your home for sale. You can work with a real estate agent or sell directly. The key is pricing it right and moving quickly.

**[GRAPHIC: "Step 3: Communicate with Your Lender"]**

Step three: Let your lender know you're selling. This is important. Many lenders will actually postpone the foreclosure sale if they know a legitimate sale is in progress. They'd rather get paid through a sale than go through the auction process.

**[B-ROLL: Phone conversation, paperwork]**

**[GRAPHIC: "Step 4: Close Before the Auction"]**

Step four: Close the sale before the auction date. Once you sell, the proceeds go to pay off your mortgage, any liens, and closing costs. Whatever's left? That's yours.

## BENEFITS OF SELLING VS. LETTING IT FORECLOSE (2:45-3:30)

**[On camera, earnest]**

"Now let me tell you why selling is almost always better than letting the foreclosure happen.

**[GRAPHIC: "Benefit #1: Protect Your Credit"]**

Benefit number one: Your credit. A foreclosure stays on your credit report for SEVEN years and can drop your score by 100 to 150 points or more. A regular sale? Barely affects your credit at all. Even a short sale is significantly less damaging.

**[GRAPHIC: Credit score comparison visual]**

**[GRAPHIC: "Benefit #2: Walk Away with Money"]**

Benefit number two: You might walk away with cash. If you have equity, that money is yours. In a foreclosure, you get nothing.

**[B-ROLL: Cash/check, family looking relieved]**

**[GRAPHIC: "Benefit #3: Control the Process"]**

Benefit number three: You stay in control. YOU choose when to move. YOU choose the terms. In a foreclosure, the sheriff shows up and tells you when to leave.

**[GRAPHIC: "Benefit #4: Fresh Start"]**

Benefit number four: A faster fresh start. After a foreclosure, you might have to wait 7 years to buy another home. After a sale, you could potentially buy again much sooner.

## TIME IS CRITICAL (3:30-4:00)

**[On camera, urgent but supportive]**

"Now here's the catch: time matters. A lot.

Selling a home takes time. Finding a buyer, negotiating, inspections, escrow, all of that takes weeks, sometimes months.

**[GRAPHIC: "Average home sale timeline: 30-60+ days"]**

If your auction is scheduled for next week, selling through traditional means is going to be tough.

That's why the earlier you start exploring this option, the better. The more time you have, the more options you have for buyers, and the better price you can get.

**[B-ROLL: Calendar, clock]**

Don't wait until the last minute. If selling might be your best option, start that conversation NOW."
