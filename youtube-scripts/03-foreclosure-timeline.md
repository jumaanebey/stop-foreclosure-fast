## HOOK (0:00-0:05)

**[On camera, urgent but calm]**

"How much time do you REALLY have before losing your home to foreclosure in California? The answer might surprise you. Let's break it down day by day."

**[B-ROLL: Calendar flipping, clock ticking]**

## INTRO (0:05-0:40)

**[On camera]**

"Hey, I'm [Name] from My Foreclosure Solution. And if you're worried about foreclosure, one of the biggest questions on your mind is probably: how much time do I have?

Here's the thing: California has some of the strongest homeowner protections in the country. The foreclosure process here takes longer than most states, which means you have more time to explore your options.

But, and this is important, that time goes FAST if you're not using it wisely.

So let me walk you through the exact California foreclosure timeline, step by step, so you know exactly what to expect and when to act."

## PRE-FORECLOSURE: BEFORE IT OFFICIALLY STARTS (0:40-1:30)

**[On camera with timeline graphic]**

"Let's start before foreclosure even officially begins.

In California, you typically need to be at least 120 days behind on your mortgage before your lender can file a Notice of Default. That's about four missed payments.

**[GRAPHIC: Timeline showing "120+ Days Delinquent"]**

But here's something most people don't know: before your lender can even start foreclosure, they're required by California law to contact you and explore alternatives. This is called the 'pre-foreclosure contact requirement.'

**[B-ROLL: Phone ringing, letters in mailbox]**

They have to make at least one phone call attempt AND send written communication at least 30 days before filing that Notice of Default.

Why does this matter? Because if your lender didn't follow these rules, you might have grounds to challenge the foreclosure. That's why documenting everything is so important.

**[GRAPHIC: "Document all lender communication"]**

So even before the official clock starts, you've already got some time and some protections."

## NOTICE OF DEFAULT: THE CLOCK STARTS (1:30-2:30)

**[On camera with timeline updating]**

"Okay, now let's say your lender files a Notice of Default, also called an NOD. This is the official start of the foreclosure process.

**[GRAPHIC: "DAY 1: Notice of Default Recorded"]**

This document gets recorded with your county recorder's office, and your lender has to mail you a copy within 10 business days.

Now here's the key deadline: you have a minimum of 90 days from when the NOD is recorded before your lender can take the next step.

**[GRAPHIC: Timeline showing "90-Day Reinstatement Period" highlighted]**

This 90-day period is called the 'reinstatement period.' During this time, you have the legal right to stop the foreclosure by paying what you owe, bringing your loan current.

But here's what I tell everyone: don't wait until day 89. Use these 90 days to explore ALL your options. Loan modification, forbearance, selling your home, whatever makes sense for your situation.

**[B-ROLL: Person reviewing options, meeting with advisor]**

These 90 days are your golden window. Don't waste them."

## NOTICE OF TRUSTEE SALE: THE AUCTION IS SCHEDULED (2:30-3:30)

**[On camera with timeline updating]**

"If you haven't resolved the situation after 90 days, your lender can file a Notice of Trustee Sale, or NTS.

**[GRAPHIC: "DAY 91+: Notice of Trustee Sale"]**

This is the document that actually schedules your home for auction. And yes, that sounds terrifying. But stay with me.

California law requires that the auction can't happen for at least 21 days after the NTS is recorded.

**[GRAPHIC: Timeline showing "21-Day Minimum Before Auction"]**

During these 21 days, you still have options:

You can reinstate your loan by paying everything owed up until FIVE business days before the sale.

**[GRAPHIC: "You can reinstate up to 5 days before sale"]**

You can potentially sell your home.

You can file for bankruptcy, which triggers an automatic stay and stops the sale.

**[B-ROLL: Courthouse, person signing documents]**

So from Notice of Default to actual auction? We're talking a minimum of 111 days. In reality, it often takes 4 to 6 months, sometimes longer.

**[GRAPHIC: "Minimum: 111 Days | Typical: 4-6+ Months"]**"

## THE TRUSTEE SALE: AUCTION DAY (3:30-4:15)

**[On camera, serious tone]**

"Now let's talk about auction day, because this is the deadline you absolutely cannot miss.

**[GRAPHIC: "AUCTION DAY: Trustee Sale"]**

On this day, your home is sold at a public auction, usually at the county courthouse steps. The highest bidder wins, and if no one bids, the bank takes ownership.

**[B-ROLL: Courthouse steps, auction scene]**

Once this happens, it's essentially over. You lose your home, your equity, and your options.

The sale can be postponed, sometimes multiple times. But you cannot count on that. You have to treat every scheduled sale date as the real deal.

After the sale, you have no redemption period in California for non-judicial foreclosures. That means you can't buy your home back after the auction.

**[GRAPHIC: "No redemption period in California"]**

This is why timing matters so much. Once that gavel falls, it's done."

## KEY DEADLINES SUMMARY (4:15-4:45)

**[On camera with full timeline graphic]**

"Let me give you the quick summary of key deadlines:

**[GRAPHIC: Full timeline appearing step by step]**

- 120+ days delinquent: Lender can start foreclosure process
- Day 1: Notice of Default recorded, 90-day reinstatement period begins
- Day 90+: Notice of Trustee Sale can be recorded
- 21+ days later: Trustee Sale/Auction can occur
- 5 days before sale: Last day to reinstate your loan

**[GRAPHIC: All deadlines listed clearly]**

Minimum total time: 111 days. Typical time: 4 to 6 months or more.

But remember: the longer you wait, the fewer options you have. The best time to act was yesterday. The second best time is right now."

## WHEN TO ACT (4:45-5:15)

**[On camera, leaning in]**

"So when should you take action? Here's my honest advice:

**[B-ROLL: Person picking up phone, visiting website]**

The MOMENT you realize you might miss a mortgage payment, reach out for help. Seriously. Don't wait for the Notice of Default.

If you've already received a Notice of Default, act within the first 30 days. Give yourself time to explore all your options.

If you're approaching the Notice of Trustee Sale, you need to move fast. Like, this week fast.

**[GRAPHIC: "The earlier you act, the more options you have"]**

I've seen too many people wait until the last minute, thinking they'll figure something out. Then they run out of time. Don't let that be you."
