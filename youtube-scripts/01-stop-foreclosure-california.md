## OPTION 1: LOAN MODIFICATION (0:45-2:00)

**[On camera with graphic showing "Option 1: Loan Modification"]**

"Option number one is a loan modification. This is where your lender agrees to change the terms of your existing loan to make your payments more affordable.

This could mean:
- Lowering your interest rate
- Extending your loan term
- Adding missed payments to the back of your loan
- Or even reducing your principal balance in some cases

**[B-ROLL: Person on phone with bank, paperwork being reviewed]**

Here's the thing though. Banks don't make this easy. You'll need to provide financial documents, write a hardship letter, and follow up constantly. Miss one deadline? They might deny you.

The good news? California law requires lenders to evaluate you for a loan modification before they can foreclose. That's called the California Homeowner Bill of Rights.

But here's my honest advice: don't try to navigate this alone. One mistake in your application can set you back months."

## OPTION 2: FORBEARANCE AGREEMENT (2:00-3:00)

**[On camera with graphic showing "Option 2: Forbearance Agreement"]**

"Option two is a forbearance agreement. This is basically a pause button on your mortgage payments.

If you've hit a temporary hardship, like a job loss, medical emergency, or unexpected expense, your lender might agree to let you pause or reduce your payments for a few months.

**[B-ROLL: Calendar pages turning, person breathing sigh of relief]**

Now here's the catch: forbearance doesn't make those payments disappear. You'll still owe them eventually. But it buys you breathing room to get back on your feet.

This works best when you have a clear path back to financial stability. If your situation is more long-term, we need to look at other options."

## OPTION 3: SELL YOUR HOME (3:00-4:30)

**[On camera with graphic showing "Option 3: Sell Your Home"]**

"Option three, and this surprises a lot of people: you can sell your home to stop foreclosure. Yes, even if you're behind on payments. Even if you've received a Notice of Default.

**[B-ROLL: "SOLD" sign going up on house, family walking into new home]**

Here's why this might be your best option: California home values have gone up significantly. You might have more equity than you realize. That means you could sell your home, pay off your mortgage, and walk away with cash in your pocket.

Even if you owe more than your home is worth, you might qualify for a short sale, where the bank agrees to accept less than what's owed.

The key is timing. You need to move fast because once that foreclosure auction happens, you lose all control.

And here's something people don't realize: selling during foreclosure often gets you a better price than a foreclosure auction, and it protects your credit way more than a foreclosure would."

## OPTION 4: BANKRUPTCY (4:30-5:30)

**[On camera with graphic showing "Option 4: Bankruptcy"]**

"Option four is bankruptcy. Now I know, that word sounds scary. But hear me out.

Filing for bankruptcy triggers something called an 'automatic stay.' That's a legal order that immediately stops all collection activity, including foreclosure.

**[B-ROLL: Gavel, courthouse exterior]**

Chapter 13 bankruptcy can be especially powerful. It lets you create a repayment plan to catch up on missed payments over three to five years while keeping your home.

Chapter 7 might buy you time, but it won't save your home in most cases.

Now bankruptcy isn't right for everyone, and it does affect your credit. But if you're facing foreclosure AND other debts, it might be the fresh start you need.

I always recommend talking to a qualified bankruptcy attorney to see if this makes sense for your situation."

## WHICH OPTION IS RIGHT FOR YOU? (5:30-6:15)

**[On camera, leaning in slightly]**

"So which option is right for YOU? Honestly, it depends on your specific situation:

- How far behind are you on payments?
- What's your home worth compared to what you owe?
- Is your income stable or uncertain?
- What are your long-term goals?
