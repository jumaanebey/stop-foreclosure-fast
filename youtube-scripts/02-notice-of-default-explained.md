**[On camera, holding paper document]**

"You just got a Notice of Default. Your heart dropped. But before you panic, watch this. You have more time than you think."

**[B-ROLL: Mailbox, official envelope being opened]**

## INTRO (0:05-0:35)

**[On camera]**

"I'm [Name] from My Foreclosure Solution, and if you're watching this, you probably just received one of the scariest pieces of mail a homeowner can get: a Notice of Default.

Take a breath. Seriously, take a breath right now.

This is serious, but it's NOT the end. This is actually the beginning of a process, and you still have options. Let me explain exactly what this document means and what you need to do next."

## WHAT IS A NOTICE OF DEFAULT? (0:35-1:30)

**[On camera with graphic]**

"Okay, so what IS a Notice of Default? In simple terms, it's your lender's official way of saying: 'You're behind on your mortgage, and we're starting the foreclosure process.'

**[B-ROLL: Close-up of Notice of Default document, with key sections highlighted]**

In California, your lender has to record this document with your county recorder's office. That makes it public record. And they have to mail you a copy.

Here's what's on it:
- The amount you owe, including missed payments, late fees, and other charges
- A description of your property
- And a statement that foreclosure proceedings have begun

**[GRAPHIC: Bullet points appearing on screen]**

Now here's the important part: this is NOT a notice that your home is being sold. Not yet. This is the first formal step in California's foreclosure process, and it starts the clock on some important deadlines."

## THE TIMELINE: HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU HAVE? (1:30-2:30)

**[On camera with timeline graphic building on screen]**

"Let's talk timeline, because this is critical.

In California, after a Notice of Default is recorded, you have at least 90 days before your lender can take the next step.

**[GRAPHIC: Calendar showing 90-day countdown]**

During those 90 days, you have what's called a 'reinstatement period.' That means you can stop the foreclosure completely by paying what you owe, including the missed payments plus fees.

After 90 days, your lender can record a Notice of Trustee Sale. That's the notice that sets an actual auction date for your home.

**[GRAPHIC: Timeline showing Notice of Default → 90 days → Notice of Trustee Sale → 21 days → Auction]**

But even THEN, you get at least 21 more days before the sale can happen.

So from Notice of Default to auction? You're looking at a minimum of 111 days. Often it's longer.

That's time. That's opportunity. But only if you use it wisely."

## ACTIONS TO TAKE RIGHT NOW (2:30-3:45)

**[On camera, leaning in]**

"Alright, here's your action plan. What you need to do RIGHT NOW:

**[GRAPHIC: "Step 1" appears]**

Number one: Don't ignore this. I know it's tempting to throw that letter in a drawer and pretend it didn't happen. Don't. Every day you wait, your options shrink.

**[GRAPHIC: "Step 2" appears]**

Number two: Gather your financial documents. Pay stubs, bank statements, tax returns, a list of your monthly expenses. You'll need these for any solution we pursue.

**[B-ROLL: Person organizing financial documents]**

**[GRAPHIC: "Step 3" appears]**

Number three: Understand your options. You might qualify for a loan modification, a forbearance agreement, or you might be able to sell your home and walk away with cash. I've got another video breaking down all four options. I'll link it in the description.

**[GRAPHIC: "Step 4" appears]**

Number four: Get professional help. And I mean real, licensed professionals. There are a lot of scammers out there targeting people in foreclosure. Make sure whoever you work with has proper licensing.

**[B-ROLL: Professional consultation meeting]**

That's why we make our licenses public. NMLS number 2033637, DRE number 02076038. We're legit, and we're here to help."

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID (3:45-4:15)

**[On camera]**

"Before I let you go, let me tell you the biggest mistakes I see people make at this stage:

**[GRAPHIC: "Mistake #1: Waiting too long"]**

Waiting too long to act. Those 90 days feel like a lot, but they go fast. Start exploring your options TODAY.

**[GRAPHIC: "Mistake #2: Not communicating with lender"]**

Not communicating with your lender. I know it's uncomfortable, but silence won't help you. If you're working on a solution, let them know.

**[GRAPHIC: "Mistake #3: Falling for scams"]**

Falling for scams. If someone guarantees they can stop your foreclosure for an upfront fee, run. I've got a whole video on foreclosure scams you need to watch.
