## HOOK (0:00-0:05)

**[On camera, direct and serious]**

"When you're facing foreclosure, scammers come out of the woodwork. I'm about to show you the 5 most common foreclosure scams so you don't become their next victim."

**[B-ROLL: Shady figure, warning signs]**

## INTRO (0:05-0:45)

**[On camera]**

"I'm [Name] from My Foreclosure Solution, and this is the video I wish every homeowner facing foreclosure would watch.

Here's the sad truth: foreclosure notices are public record. That means the moment you get that Notice of Default, your information is out there. And scammers know it.

They'll call you. They'll mail you. They'll knock on your door. They'll promise to save your home. And then they'll take your money and disappear.

**[B-ROLL: Mailbox full of letters, phone ringing, door knock]**

I've seen families lose tens of thousands of dollars to these predators on top of already losing their homes. It's heartbreaking.

So let me show you exactly what to watch out for."

## SCAM #1: THE UPFRONT FEE SCAM (0:45-1:40)

**[On camera with graphic]**

"Scam number one: The upfront fee scam.

**[GRAPHIC: "SCAM #1: Upfront Fee Scam"]**

This is the most common one. Someone contacts you promising to negotiate with your lender, modify your loan, or stop your foreclosure. But first, they need a fee. Maybe a few hundred dollars, maybe a few thousand.

You pay it because you're desperate. And then? Nothing happens. They don't do the work, they don't return your calls, and they're gone.

**[B-ROLL: Money exchanging hands, person looking frustrated]**

Here's what you need to know: In California, it's actually ILLEGAL for a foreclosure consultant to collect any fees until they've fully performed their services.

**[GRAPHIC: "California Law: No upfront fees for foreclosure consultants"]**

Let me say that again: NO upfront fees until the work is done. That's California Civil Code Section 2945. If someone asks for money upfront to help with your foreclosure, that's your first red flag.

## SCAM #2: THE FAKE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM (1:40-2:30)

**[On camera with graphic]**

"Scam number two: Fake government programs.

**[GRAPHIC: "SCAM #2: Fake Government Programs"]**

These scammers will contact you claiming to be from a government agency or a special government-backed program. They'll use official-sounding names, maybe even logos that look legitimate.

They'll say things like 'You've been selected for the federal mortgage relief program' or 'We're from the Obama mortgage bailout office.'

**[B-ROLL: Official-looking letterhead, person on phone acting professional]**

Here's the truth: real government programs don't cold-call you. They don't charge fees. And programs like HAMP ended years ago.

**[GRAPHIC: "Real government programs don't cold-call or charge fees"]**

If you want to explore legitimate government assistance, go directly to HUD.gov or contact a HUD-approved housing counselor. Those services are free.

**[GRAPHIC: "HUD.gov - Free legitimate help"]**

Never trust someone who contacts YOU claiming to be from the government."

## SCAM #3: THE BAIT AND SWITCH (2:30-3:20)

**[On camera with graphic]**

"Scam number three: The bait and switch, also known as the 'sign here' scam.

**[GRAPHIC: "SCAM #3: Bait and Switch / Sign Here Scam"]**

This one is truly evil. A scammer offers to help you refinance or modify your loan. They put a stack of papers in front of you and say 'just sign here.'

What you don't realize is buried in those papers is a deed transfer. You just signed your home over to them.

**[B-ROLL: Stack of paperwork, pen signing documents, person looking shocked]**

Now they own your house. They might let you stay as a 'renter,' collecting payments while never actually paying the mortgage. Eventually, the house is foreclosed anyway, but they've walked away with your money and your equity.

**[GRAPHIC: "NEVER sign documents you don't understand"]**

The rule is simple: NEVER sign any document you don't fully understand. If someone won't give you time to read everything or have an attorney review it, walk away immediately."

## SCAM #4: THE LEASEBACK SCHEME (3:20-4:10)

**[On camera with graphic]**

"Scam number four: The leaseback scheme.

**[GRAPHIC: "SCAM #4: Leaseback Scheme"]**

Here's how this works: someone offers to buy your home and 'rent' it back to you. They say you can buy it back later once you're back on your feet.

Sounds like a lifeline, right? It's usually a trap.

**[B-ROLL: Contract signing, person shaking hands]**

They buy your home at a steep discount. They charge you rent that's often higher than your old mortgage payment. And that 'buyback option'? The terms are impossible to meet, or it doesn't exist at all.

You end up losing your home AND paying more than you ever did before, with no path to ownership.

**[GRAPHIC: "If the deal sounds too good to be true, it is"]**

If someone offers to save your home by buying it from you, be extremely cautious. Get independent legal advice before signing anything."

## SCAM #5: THE PHANTOM HELP SCAM (4:10-4:50)

**[On camera with graphic]**

"Scam number five: Phantom help.

**[GRAPHIC: "SCAM #5: Phantom Help"]**

In this scam, someone charges you for services you could get for free or that they never actually provide.

They might charge you hundreds of dollars for a loan modification application that you could submit yourself.

They might take your money to 'negotiate with your lender' but never actually contact the bank.

They might promise to represent you but have no legal qualifications to do so.

**[B-ROLL: Empty desk, phone going to voicemail]**

Meanwhile, your foreclosure is progressing and you're running out of time.

**[GRAPHIC: "Verify credentials before paying anyone"]**

Always verify credentials. Ask for license numbers. Check with the California Department of Real Estate or the NMLS system."

## HOW TO VERIFY LEGITIMATE HELP (4:50-5:30)

**[On camera, helpful tone]**

"Okay, so how do you find REAL help? Here's your checklist.

**[GRAPHIC: Checklist appearing item by item]**

Number one: Check for proper licensing. In California, anyone helping with foreclosure should be licensed. Ask for their NMLS number and DRE license number, then verify them online.

Number two: No upfront fees. Remember, legitimate foreclosure consultants can't charge until the work is done.

Number three: Get everything in writing. Legitimate professionals will provide clear contracts explaining exactly what they'll do.

Number four: Take your time. Anyone pressuring you to sign immediately is hiding something.

Number five: Trust your gut. If something feels off, it probably is.

**[B-ROLL: Person researching on computer, official license documentation]**

For the record, we're completely transparent about our credentials. Our NMLS number is 2033637, our DRE license is 02076038. You can verify us anytime."
