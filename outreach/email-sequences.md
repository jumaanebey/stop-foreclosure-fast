### Email 2: Day 1 (If no response)
**Subject:** Your 4 options to stop foreclosure

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to share the four main options California homeowners have to stop foreclosure:

**1. Loan Modification**
Keep your home with new loan terms. Best if you have income and want to stay.

**2. Forbearance**
Pause payments temporarily. Best if your hardship is short-term.

**3. Short Sale**
Sell for less than you owe, lender forgives the rest. Best if you're underwater.

**4. Sell Before Auction**
Sell fast, keep your equity. Best if you have equity to protect.

Which sounds most relevant to your situation? Just reply to this email.

Or schedule a call: [Schedule Free Consultation]

### Email 3: Day 3
**Subject:** The clock is ticking (but you still have options)

Hi {{first_name}},

I don't want to add to your stress - but I do want to make sure you know that time matters in foreclosure.

Here's the California timeline:
- **Notice of Default** → 90 days until Notice of Sale
- **Notice of Trustee Sale** → 21+ days until auction
- **After auction** → Options are gone

Where are you in this timeline?

If you're not sure, let's talk. I can look up your property's status for free.

### Email 3: Day 5
**Subject:** What most people get wrong about foreclosure

Hi {{first_name}},

The biggest mistake I see homeowners make?

**Waiting too long.**

By the time they reach out, they've lost months of options. The earlier you act, the more choices you have.

If you're still in the research phase, that's fine. But don't let research become procrastination.

When you're ready: (949) 565-5285

**Subject:** About the letter I sent regarding {{property_address}}

Hi {{first_name}},

I recently sent you a letter about your property at {{property_address}}.

I know receiving that letter probably wasn't pleasant. But I want you to know: I'm not here to pressure you. I'm here to help if you want it.

I noticed a Notice of Default was filed on your property. That means you still have time - but that time is limited.

No obligation. Just information.
