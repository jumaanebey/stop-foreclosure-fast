When your probate clients inherit a property with a delinquent mortgage, I can help them:
- Negotiate with lenders to buy time
- Sell quickly to preserve estate equity

I'd be happy to be a resource for your clients at no cost. Would you have 10 minutes to chat?

## 3. Real Estate Agents

**Subject:** I take the deals you can't

Hi [Name],

I know you occasionally come across sellers in pre-foreclosure who need to move fast - often too fast for a traditional listing.

I specialize in exactly those situations. When you have a client who:
- Is behind on payments
- Has an auction date approaching
- Needs to sell in days, not months

Send them my way. I'll take care of them, and I'm happy to discuss referral arrangements.

Let me know if you'd like to chat.

## 4. Bankruptcy Attorneys

**Subject:** Alternative to bankruptcy for your foreclosure clients

Hi [Name],

Many of your clients file bankruptcy specifically to stop foreclosure - but sometimes there are faster, less damaging alternatives.

I work with California homeowners to:
- Negotiate loan modifications
- Facilitate quick sales before auction
- Pursue short sales when underwater

For clients where bankruptcy isn't the best fit, I'd be happy to offer a free consultation. Would you be open to being a referral resource for each other?
