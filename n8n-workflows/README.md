## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Check Execution Logs:
1. Go to "Executions" tab in n8n
2. See history of all workflow runs
3. Green = success, Red = error
4. Click any execution to see detailed logs

### Common Issues:

**"Could not connect to Google Sheets"**
- Re-authenticate your Google OAuth2 credential
- Make sure sheet ID is correct
- Verify sheet tab name is "NOD Leads"

**"Email not sending"**
- Check SMTP credentials
- Use Gmail App Password (not regular password)
- Verify Gmail allows "Less secure apps" or use App Password

**"SMS not sending"**
- Verify Twilio phone number is correct (include +1)
- Check Twilio account balance
- Make sure phone number includes country code

**"Workflow not triggering"**
- Make sure workflow is "Active" (toggle in top-right)
- Check schedule settings (time zones!)
- View execution logs for errors

## Execution Limits

### n8n Cloud Free Tier:
- 2,500 executions/month
- Good for ~50-100 leads/month

**Example:**
- Email follow-up: 4 checks/hour √ó 24 hours √ó 30 days = 2,880/month ‚ùå (too many)
- Solution: Change to "Every 30 minutes" = 1,440/month ‚úÖ

### n8n Cloud Starter ($20/month):
- 20,000 executions/month
- Good for 500+ leads/month

### Self-Hosted:
- Unlimited executions
- Free forever
- Requires server/computer to run 24/7

---

## Optimization Tips

### Reduce Execution Count:

**Workflow 1 (Email):**
- Change from "Every 15 min" ‚Üí "Every 30 min" or "Every 1 hour"
- Still fast enough for lead response

**Workflow 3 (SMS):**
- Change from "Every 6 hours" ‚Üí "Every 12 hours"
- 48-hour delay is still effective

### Use Webhooks Instead of Polling:

For instant triggers (advanced):
1. Use Google Sheets Trigger node (webhook-based)
2. Only executes when row is actually added
3. Saves executions vs. polling every X minutes

---

## Advanced Customization

### Customize Email Templates:
Edit the "message" field in "Send Initial Email" node with your own copy.

### Add More Filters:
Add additional "IF" nodes to filter by:
- County (only LA County)
- Days Since NOD (only urgent leads)
- Property value (only high-value)

### Add More Actions:
After sending email, you can:
- Add to Airtable CRM
- Create task in Monday.com
- Post to Slack channel
- Add to Mailchimp list

### Drip Campaign Sequence:

Create multiple workflows:
```
Day 0: New lead ‚Üí Send initial email
Day 2: No response ‚Üí Send follow-up email
Day 3: No response ‚Üí Send SMS
Day 7: No response ‚Üí Send value email
Day 14: No response ‚Üí Final outreach
```

Each workflow filters by "Last Contact" date and status.
