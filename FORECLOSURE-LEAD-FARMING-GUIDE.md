## Cold Calling Script for NOD Leads

**Opening (First 10 seconds are critical):**

"Hi, is this [OWNER NAME]? This is [YOUR NAME] with My Foreclosure Solution. I'm calling because I saw you received a notice on your property at [ADDRESS]. I specialize in helping California homeowners stop foreclosure - I've stopped sales the day before auction. Do you have 5 minutes to discuss your options? Everything is confidential and there's no cost for the consultation."

**If they say YES:**

"Great. First, I want you to know you're not alone and you still have options. Can you tell me what's happening with your situation right now?"

**Listen for:**
- Why they fell behind (job loss, medical, divorce)
- How far behind they are
- If they want to keep the home or sell
- Timeline urgency (30 days? 60 days? 90 days?)

**Key Questions:**
1. "When did you receive the Notice of Default?"
2. "How many payments are you behind?"
3. "Do you want to keep your home or would you consider selling?"
4. "Have you spoken with your lender about a loan modification?"
5. "What's your home worth versus what you owe?" (equity check)

**If they have EQUITY (home worth more than loan):**

"Here's the good news - you have about $[X] in equity. That means you have options. We can either:
1. Help you sell quickly and walk away with cash
2. Negotiate with your lender to stop the foreclosure
3. Find you a short-term loan to catch up payments

Would you like to schedule a free consultation this week? I can come to you or we can meet at my office."

**If they have NO EQUITY (underwater):**

"I understand. The good news is we can still help. We specialize in short sales where you can walk away without owing the bank anything, and we handle all the paperwork. We've helped over 500 families in this exact situation. Can we schedule 15 minutes to review your options?"

**If they say NO / NOT INTERESTED:**

"I completely understand. Can I just send you our free 7-Day Foreclosure Survival Guide? It explains all your rights and options - no cost, no obligation. What's the best email for you?"

(Get email, add to email list, send free guide)

**If they're RUDE / HANG UP:**

Mark as "Dead - Not Interested" and move on. You need 100 calls to get 10 conversations to get 1-2 appointments.

## Automating the Process

### Option 1: Pay for Data Service (Fastest)

**ForeclosureRadar.com** ($100-300/month)
- Automated daily NOD updates for all CA counties
- Includes property details, owner info, photos
- Export to CSV, import to your Google Sheet
- Saves 10+ hours/week

**ROI Calculation:**
- Cost: $200/month
- Time saved: 40 hours/month
- Leads delivered: 500-1000/month
- If you close 1 extra deal = $5,000-18,000
- Pays for itself 25x-90x over

**Recommendation:** If you close your first deal ($5k+), immediately subscribe to ForeclosureRadar.

### Option 2: Build Your Own Scraper (Advanced)

I can build you a Python scraper that:
- Checks LA County recorder daily
- Finds new NOD filings
- Extracts property address, owner name, recording date
- Automatically adds to your Google Sheet
- Runs on autopilot

**Requirements:**
- Python installed on your computer
- Google Sheets API access (free)
- Runs daily on your computer or cloud server

**Time to build:** 2-4 hours
**Cost:** $0 (just your time)
**Downside:** Only works for 1 county at a time, breaks if website changes

Would you like me to build this for LA County?

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best for Starting)

**Week 1-2:** Manual collection (learn the process, get first deals)
**Week 3-4:** Subscribe to ForeclosureRadar if you've closed a deal
**Ongoing:** Automated leads + cold calling = consistent pipeline

## Legal & Compliance Notes

**California DRE Compliance:**
- You're licensed (DRE #02076038) ✅
- You can offer foreclosure assistance services ✅
- Cannot charge upfront fees for loan modifications (CA Civil Code 2944.7) ⚠️
- Must provide written contract before collecting any fees ✅

**Foreclosure Consultant Law:**
- If you're providing "foreclosure consulting" (helping them stay in home), you're regulated under Civil Code 2945
- Must give them 5-day right to cancel
- Cannot take power of attorney or deed
- Cannot claim you can stop foreclosure (say "help" not "guarantee")

**Safe Approach:**
- Position yourself as real estate agent helping them sell
- Offer free consultation
- If they want loan mod help, refer to attorney or do it for free
- Make money on the sale/commission side
