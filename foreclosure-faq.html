                        <p>For most California homeowners: <strong>No, you won't owe money after foreclosure</strong> on your first mortgage.</p>
                        <p>California is a "non-recourse" state for purchase money first mortgages on primary residences. However, you may owe money if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>You have a second mortgage or HELOC</li>

                        <p><strong>Yes, selling is almost always better than foreclosure.</strong> Here's why:</p>
                        <p><strong>Benefits of selling:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Less damage to your credit (stays higher for loans)</li>

                            <li>May walk away with cash instead of owing money</li>
                            <li>Avoid foreclosure appearing on background checks</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Foreclosure downsides:</strong></p>
                        <ul>

                            <li>Difficulty getting future loans</li>

                        <p>Costs vary significantly by method:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Loan Reinstatement:</strong> All missed payments + late fees + legal costs (often $10,000-50,000+)</li>
                            <li><strong>Loan Modification:</strong> Usually free, may require small processing fee</li>
                            <li><strong>Selling Your Home:</strong> $0 if you get a cash offer that covers your mortgage</li>
                            <li><strong>Short Sale:</strong> Usually free, lender pays most costs</li>
                            <li><strong>Deed in Lieu:</strong> Free, may qualify for relocation assistance</li>
                            <li><strong>Bankruptcy:</strong> $3,000-5,000 in attorney fees plus court costs</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Free options:</strong> HUD counseling, our foreclosure consultation, and many lender workout programs cost nothing to explore.</p>

                        <h3>Can I get cash when selling my house in foreclosure? <span class="faq-toggle">+</span></h3>
                    </div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p><strong>Yes, you may get cash if your home is worth more than you owe.</strong></p>
                        <p>Here's how it works:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We evaluate your home's current market value</li>
                            <li>Calculate what you owe (mortgage + fees + back payments)</li>
                            <li>If there's equity, you get the difference at closing</li>
                            <li>Even if you're "underwater," you avoid owing money later</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Example:</strong> If your home is worth $400,000 and you owe $350,000 total, you could get $50,000 cash (minus small closing costs).</p>
                        <p>Even with no cash, stopping foreclosure protects your credit and gives you a fresh start.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p><strong>You're still responsible</strong> for property taxes and insurance until the home is sold or transferred.</p>
                        <p><strong>Important points:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unpaid property taxes become a lien on the property</li>
                            <li>Your homeowner's insurance should stay active (liability protection)</li>
                            <li>Some lenders will pay taxes/insurance and add to what you owe</li>
                            <li>If you sell before foreclosure, these get paid at closing</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Don't let these bills pile up - they can complicate your situation even more.</p>
