                        <div class="faq-question">My auction is in 3 days. Is it too late?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>It's not too late! We've stopped foreclosures the day before auction. The key is acting NOW. Call us immediately at (949) 565-5285. We can file emergency paperwork, negotiate with your lender, or arrange a quick sale. Every hour counts at this stage.</p>
                        </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <div class="faq-question">Can you really stop a foreclosure in 7 days?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Yes, through several legal methods: filing for bankruptcy (immediate automatic stay), requesting emergency loan modification, arranging a short sale, or finding a cash buyer. The exact strategy depends on your situation, which is why we need to evaluate your case immediately.</p>
                        </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <div class="faq-question">What if I just ignore the notices?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Please don't. Ignoring the notices won't make this go away. The bank will proceed with the sale, you'll be evicted (often by sheriff), and you'll lose any equity in your home. Even if you're overwhelmed, one phone call to us can change everything. We handle the stressful parts for you.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>In California, after a Notice of Default, you typically have 90 days before a Notice of Sale is recorded, then another 21 days before auction. But don't wait - the sooner we start, the more options you'll have and the better outcome we can achieve.</p>

                            <p>Within 30 minutes, we'll call you for a private, no-pressure conversation. We'll review your situation, explain all your options (keep the home, sell it, or walk away), and create an action plan. If you decide to work with us, we immediately start protecting your interests.</p>

                            <p>No! Our first goal is always to help you stay if that's what you want. If staying isn't possible, we'll ensure you have time to relocate with dignity. Even in a sale, you typically have 30-60 days to move, and we can sometimes negotiate cash for relocation.</p>

                            <p>Initially, just basic information about your loan and the notices you've received. We'll help you gather everything else. Don't let missing paperwork stop you from calling - we can work with whatever you have.</p>

                            <p>Yes! We negotiate with lenders daily. We speak their language, know what they'll accept, and often achieve solutions homeowners couldn't get on their own: loan modifications, payment plans, principal reductions, or short sale approvals.</p>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Our consultation is completely FREE. If we help you sell your home, our commission comes from the sale proceeds - you don't pay anything out of pocket. If we help you keep your home through loan modification, we'll discuss any costs upfront. We never ask for money without explaining exactly what it's for.</p>
                        </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <div class="faq-question">Will I owe money after foreclosure?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>Possibly. If your home sells for less than you owe, the bank might pursue a deficiency judgment. However, we often negotiate to eliminate this debt, or structure sales that protect you from owing anything. Every situation is different, which is why professional help matters.</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-item">
                        <div class="faq-question">What if my home is worth less than I owe?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>This is called being "underwater," and we have solutions. A short sale lets you sell for less than owed (we negotiate bank approval). Sometimes loan modification can reduce principal. Even if you walk away, we can minimize the financial damage.</p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>If you have equity, YES! This is crucial - in foreclosure, the bank takes everything. But if we help you sell quickly, you keep your equity minus selling costs. We've helped clients walk away with tens of thousands instead of nothing.</p>

                            <p>Never. Life happens - job loss, medical bills, divorce, business failure. We've seen it all and we're not here to judge. You're taking a brave step by seeking help. We treat every client with respect and dignity, focusing on solutions, not blame.</p>

                            <p>We handle everything discreetly. While foreclosure notices are public record, we can often resolve things before it becomes neighborhood knowledge. If we need to sell, we market professionally without "distressed sale" signs that embarrass you.</p>

                            <p>Foreclosure severely damages credit (200-300 point drop, 7 years on report). But alternatives like short sale or loan modification have less impact. We'll explain how each option affects your credit and help you choose the path that preserves your financial future.</p>
