**Headline:** My Foreclosure Solution Launches Free Foreclosure Survival Guide as California Filings Surge Past 367,000

**Subheadline:** Licensed real estate professionals release 12-page emergency action plan for homeowners facing foreclosure across all 58 California counties

**Body:**

CALIFORNIA — February 2026 — As California foreclosure filings surpass 367,000 properties — marking 11 consecutive months of year-over-year increases — My Foreclosure Solution has released a free 12-page Foreclosure Survival Guide designed to help homeowners take immediate action to protect their homes and equity.

The guide, available for instant download at https://myforeclosuresolution.com/free-guide.html, covers emergency timelines, lender negotiation scripts, California-specific legal protections under the Homeowner Bill of Rights, and equity preservation strategies.

"Most homeowners don't realize they still have options after receiving a Notice of Default," said the founder of My Foreclosure Solution. "California law provides significant protections that many families never learn about until it's too late. We created this guide so homeowners can take the right steps in the critical first 7 days."

The Guide Covers:

- Day-by-day emergency action plan for the first week after a foreclosure notice
- Word-for-word scripts for calling lenders and servicers
- California Homeowner Bill of Rights protections most families don't know about
- 5 proven alternatives to foreclosure, including loan modification, forbearance, short sale, and cash offers
- Equity protection strategies to prevent unnecessary financial loss
- Warning signs of foreclosure rescue scams and how to verify legitimate help

A Growing Crisis

According to ATTOM Data Solutions, California remains among the states with the highest foreclosure activity in the nation. Filings have increased steadily since early 2025, with Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Sacramento counties seeing some of the sharpest rises.

The California Attorney General's office has also warned of a spike in foreclosure rescue scams targeting vulnerable homeowners, including fraudulent title transfer schemes and phantom help operations that charge fees for services never delivered.

"Homeowners in crisis are prime targets for scammers," the founder added. "That's why we provide free consultations with no fees and no pressure. We're licensed real estate professionals — DRE #02076038 and NMLS #2033637 — and we believe every family deserves honest guidance."

**Headline:** California Foreclosure Filings Hit 11-Month Growth Streak: Local Expert Urges Homeowners to Act Early

**Subheadline:** My Foreclosure Solution reports surge in consultation requests as Riverside, San Bernardino, and Sacramento counties see steepest filing increases

**Body:**

CALIFORNIA — March 2026 — California's foreclosure crisis continues to deepen as ATTOM Data Solutions reports 11 consecutive months of year-over-year increases in foreclosure filings statewide. With more than 367,000 properties receiving foreclosure-related notices in the past year, licensed real estate professional and My Foreclosure Solution founder is urging homeowners to explore their options before reaching the point of no return.

"The biggest mistake homeowners make is waiting," said the founder of My Foreclosure Solution. "By the time most families call us, they've already lost weeks or months of time that could have been spent pursuing a loan modification, forbearance plan, or other alternative. California's foreclosure timeline moves faster than people think."

California by the Numbers

- 367,000+ properties received foreclosure filings statewide in the past 12 months
- 11 consecutive months of year-over-year increases in filing activity
- Los Angeles County continues to lead the state in total filings
- Riverside and San Bernardino counties have seen some of the largest percentage increases
- Sacramento and Fresno counties are emerging as new hotspots for foreclosure activity

Why the Surge?

Industry analysts point to several converging factors driving the increase:

- Expiration of pandemic-era protections — forbearance agreements and moratoriums that shielded millions of homeowners have fully expired
- Rising interest rates — homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages are seeing monthly payments increase by hundreds or even thousands of dollars
- Insurance costs — California homeowners insurance premiums have skyrocketed, adding to monthly housing costs
- Cost of living pressure — inflation in groceries, gas, and utilities has stretched household budgets to the breaking point

What Homeowners Should Know

My Foreclosure Solution outlines five critical steps for any California homeowner who has missed a payment or received a foreclosure notice:

1. Don't ignore the mail. Every notice has a deadline attached to it.
2. Call your lender immediately. Ask about loss mitigation options before the process advances.
3. Know your rights. California's Homeowner Bill of Rights requires lenders to consider alternatives before proceeding to sale.
4. Get a free consultation. A licensed professional can evaluate your situation and outline every available option.
5. Beware of scams. Never sign over your title or pay upfront fees to anyone promising to "save" your home.

"We offer free consultations to homeowners anywhere in California — no fees, no obligation," the founder said. "Sometimes the best option is a loan modification. Sometimes it's a short sale or a cash offer. But you can't make the right decision if you don't know all your options."

**Headline:** Foreclosure Rescue Scams Surge in California: Licensed Professionals Warn Homeowners to Verify Before Trusting

**Subheadline:** My Foreclosure Solution releases scam identification checklist as Attorney General reports rise in fraudulent title transfers and phantom help schemes

**Body:**

CALIFORNIA — March 2026 — As California foreclosure filings continue climbing, a parallel crisis is unfolding: the return of foreclosure rescue scams. My Foreclosure Solution, a licensed California real estate firm, is warning homeowners to verify credentials and watch for red flags before trusting anyone who claims they can stop a foreclosure.

"Every time foreclosure rates go up, the scammers come out," said the founder of My Foreclosure Solution. "We're hearing from homeowners who've been approached by companies demanding thousands of dollars upfront, or worse — asking them to sign over the title to their home. These are not legitimate operations."

The Most Common Foreclosure Scams in California

The California Attorney General's office and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) have identified several schemes currently targeting homeowners:

1. Title Transfer / Deed Theft
Scammers convince homeowners to sign over their property deed with promises of lease-back arrangements or guaranteed loan modifications. Once the title transfers, the homeowner loses all ownership rights and equity.

2. Phantom Help Scams
Fake "foreclosure consultants" charge fees of $1,000 to $5,000 or more for services they never deliver — and often tell homeowners to stop communicating with their lender, causing the foreclosure to accelerate.

3. Equity Skimming
A buyer offers to take over mortgage payments and "save" the home, then collects rent without making payments. The original homeowner's credit is destroyed when the lender forecloses.

4. Bait-and-Switch Refinancing
Homeowners believe they're signing loan modification paperwork, but the documents actually refinance the home at predatory terms — often with balloon payments or interest rates that make default inevitable.

5. Senior Targeting
Elderly homeowners with significant equity are specifically targeted through door-to-door visits, unsolicited phone calls, and mailers designed to look like government notices.

How to Verify Legitimate Help

My Foreclosure Solution recommends homeowners take these steps before working with any foreclosure assistance company:

- Check their license. California law requires real estate professionals to hold a DRE license. Verify at the California Bureau of Real Estate: https://www.dre.ca.gov
- Never pay upfront fees. California Civil Code Section 2945 makes it illegal for foreclosure consultants to collect fees before services are fully performed.
- Never sign over your title. No legitimate foreclosure assistance requires you to transfer ownership of your home.
- Get a second opinion. HUD-approved housing counselors provide free advice: 1-800-569-4287
- Trust your instincts. If someone pressures you to act immediately or says "don't talk to your lender," walk away.

"We provide free consultations because homeowners in crisis shouldn't have to pay just to understand their options," the founder said. "We're licensed — DRE #02076038 and NMLS #2033637 — and anyone can verify that in 30 seconds on the state's website. If a company won't give you a license number, that's your first red flag."
