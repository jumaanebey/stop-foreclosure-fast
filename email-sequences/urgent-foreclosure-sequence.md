{{first_name}},

You've been on my mind since you reached out yesterday. I know you're probably feeling overwhelmed and scared about losing your home.

**Here are 3 ways we can stop your foreclosure THIS WEEK:**

### 🛡️ **Option 1: Loan Modification Emergency Filing**
- Immediately halts foreclosure proceedings  
- Reduces your monthly payment by $200-800+  
- Success rate: 73% when filed correctly  
- **Timeline: 2-3 days to file**

### ⏰ **Option 2: Bankruptcy Chapter 13 (Temporary Relief)**
- Instant automatic stay stops foreclosure  
- Gives you 3-5 years to catch up on payments  
- Keep your home while getting back on track  
- **Timeline: Can be filed within 24 hours**

### 💰 **Option 3: Fast Cash Purchase (If You Want to Sell)**

## EMAIL 3: "Client Success Story: How We Saved Sarah's Home"
**Send: 3 days after email 1**
**Subject Line:** How Sarah saved her home with 8 days until foreclosure

{{first_name}},

I want to share Sarah's story with you because her situation was similar to yours.

**Sarah's Story:**
Sarah, a single mom in Riverside, was 8 days away from foreclosure auction. She owed $47,000 in back payments and thought it was hopeless.

"*I was getting 10+ calls per day from 'we buy houses' companies, but Jumaane was different. He actually LISTENED to what I wanted - to keep my home.*" - Sarah M.

**What we did:**
- Filed emergency loan modification within 72 hours  
- Negotiated with Chase Bank to accept $12,000 instead of $47,000  
- Reduced her payment from $2,400 to $1,850/month  
- **Total time: 6 days**

**Result:** Sarah kept her home and saved $513/month. Her kids didn't have to change schools.

**The key:** We acted FAST. Sarah didn't wait weeks to "think about it."

**Another client, David in San Diego:**
- 3 days until auction  
- Owed $89,000 in back payments  
- We negotiated a $1,200/month reduction  
- **He kept his $650,000 home**

**{{first_name}}, here's what I know:** The families who succeed are the ones who take action immediately.

**Every day you wait, your options decrease.**

📞 **Call me today: (949) 565-5285**
📱 **Or text: (949) 565-5285**

I have appointments available today and tomorrow. Let's get YOUR success story started.

Your advocate,
Jumaane Bey

P.S. - Both Sarah and David tried to handle things themselves first. They wish they had called me sooner. Don't make the same mistake.

## EMAIL 4: "Don't Wait - Foreclosure Timeline in California"
**Send: 5 days after email 1**
**Subject Line:** ⏰ California foreclosure timeline - Where are you?

{{first_name}},

I'm concerned because I haven't heard back from you yet. Maybe you're trying to handle this yourself, or you're not sure if you should trust me.

I get it. When I was facing foreclosure on my own property years ago, I was skeptical of everyone too.

**But here's what you need to know about California's foreclosure timeline:**

### 📅 **THE CALIFORNIA FORECLOSURE CLOCK:**

**Day 1-90:** Notice of Default filed  
→ *You have options, time to negotiate*

**Day 91-110:** Notice of Trustee Sale  
→ *Options decreasing, urgency increasing*  

**Day 111+:** Auction scheduled  
→ *Very limited options, emergency measures only*

**Auction Day:** House sold to highest bidder  
→ *Game over - you have 3 days to move out*

**Where are you on this timeline?** 

If you're past Day 90, every single day matters.

**The harsh reality:** 
- At Day 100: We have 5-7 solutions available  
- At Day 110: We have 2-3 solutions available  
- At Day 117: We have 1 solution available (emergency filing)  
- After auction: It's too late  

**Most people wait until Day 115+ to call me.** Don't be like most people.

I've been doing this for 12 years. I've seen hundreds of families lose their homes because they waited "just one more week."

**{{first_name}}, if you're still reading this, it means you want to save your home.**

**Stop waiting. Call me today.**

📞 (949) 565-5285  
📱 Text: "TIMELINE" and I'll call you within the hour

The clock is ticking,
Jumaane Bey

P.S. - I had a client call me at 11 PM the night before their auction. We filed emergency paperwork at 6 AM and stopped the sale. But I can't promise that will work for everyone. The earlier you call, the better your options.
