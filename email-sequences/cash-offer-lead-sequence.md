## Email 3: Address Common Concerns (Day 5)
**Subject:** Common questions about cash offers (and honest answers)

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I sent your cash offer a few days ago, and I wanted to follow up with answers to questions I commonly get:

**"Is this offer really final?"**
The offer I sent is based on the information provided. It may adjust slightly after seeing the property in person, but usually by less than 5%.

**"Why is the offer lower than market value?"**
Cash offers are typically 10-20% below retail value because:
- No financing delays or complications
- No repair negotiations
- No showings or marketing time
- Guaranteed closing

**"What if I owe more than the house is worth?"**
We can often help with short sales or other creative solutions. Don't let being "underwater" stop you from exploring options.

**"Is this legitimate?"**
Absolutely. I'm a licensed California real estate professional. We close through established title companies with full legal protection for you.

**Still have questions?** Call me: (949) 565-5285

I'm happy to explain anything about the process or your specific situation.

Best regards,
