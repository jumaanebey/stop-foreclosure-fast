## Email 2: Educational Content - Your Rights (Day 4)
**Subject:** Did you know? California homeowners have these powerful rights

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I wanted to share something important that many California homeowners don't know: you have more legal protections during foreclosure than homeowners in most other states.

**California's Homeowner Bill of Rights protects you with:**

ü§ù **Single Point of Contact** - No more getting transferred around
üö´ **Dual Tracking Prohibition** - They can't foreclose while reviewing your modification
üìã **Right to Complete Review** - Lenders must fully evaluate all your options
üìû **Accurate Information** - You deserve truthful answers about your situation

**Why this matters:**
Many foreclosures could be stopped or delayed if homeowners knew and enforced these rights. Unfortunately, not all lenders follow these laws perfectly.

**Want to learn more?** Read my detailed guide: [BLOG LINK]

**Questions about your rights?** Call (949) 328-4811 for a free consultation.

Knowledge is power, especially when facing foreclosure.

Best regards,
[YOUR_NAME]

## Email 3: Common Foreclosure Myths (Day 8)
**Subject:** 5 foreclosure myths that could cost you your home

Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I've been helping California homeowners since 2014, and I've seen too many people make costly mistakes because they believed common foreclosure myths.

**Here are 5 dangerous myths I hear regularly:**

‚ùå **MYTH:** "Foreclosure happens in 30 days"
‚úÖ **TRUTH:** California foreclosure takes 200+ days, giving you time to act

‚ùå **MYTH:** "Banks want to take your house"
‚úÖ **TRUTH:** Banks lose money on foreclosure; they prefer workout solutions

‚ùå **MYTH:** "You need perfect credit for loan modification"
‚úÖ **TRUTH:** Hardship is often the main qualification, not credit score

‚ùå **MYTH:** "Bankruptcy ruins your credit forever"
‚úÖ **TRUTH:** Strategic bankruptcy can stop foreclosure and rebuild credit faster

‚ùå **MYTH:** "Cash buyers are all scammers"
‚úÖ **TRUTH:** Licensed professionals offer legitimate quick-sale solutions

**The bottom line:** Don't let myths prevent you from exploring options that could save your home or your credit.

**Want the full story on any of these?** Call me for a free discussion: (949) 328-4811

Stay informed, stay empowered.

Best regards,
