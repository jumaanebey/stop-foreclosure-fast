                <h3>Acceleration Clause</h3>
                <p>A provision in a mortgage that allows the lender to demand full repayment of the remaining loan balance if the borrower defaults. When triggered, the entire loan becomes due immediately rather than in monthly installments.</p>

                <h3>Anti-Deficiency Laws</h3>
                <p>California laws that protect homeowners from being sued for the difference between what they owe and what their home sells for at foreclosure. California Civil Code Section 580b protects purchase money loans; Section 580d protects any loan foreclosed through non-judicial (trustee sale) process.</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> If you owe $400,000 but your home sells at auction for $350,000, California's anti-deficiency laws typically prevent the lender from suing you for the $50,000 difference.</div>

            <div class="term">
                <h3>Automatic Stay</h3>
                <p>A legal protection that immediately stops all collection actions, including foreclosure, when someone files for bankruptcy. In Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the automatic stay allows the homeowner to catch up on missed payments over 3-5 years while keeping their home.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Beneficiary</h3>
                <p>In California real estate, the beneficiary is the lender or entity that holds the beneficial interest in a deed of trust. The beneficiary has the right to foreclose if the borrower defaults.</p>

                <p>An agreement where the lender or new property owner pays the former homeowner money in exchange for voluntarily vacating the property in good condition. This avoids the time and cost of formal eviction.</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> After foreclosure, the new owner might offer $3,000-$5,000 for you to move out within 30 days and leave the property clean.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="term">
                <h3>Chapter 7 Bankruptcy</h3>
                <p>A form of bankruptcy that discharges most unsecured debts but does not allow you to catch up on missed mortgage payments. The automatic stay temporarily stops foreclosure, but unless you can reinstate or modify the loan, foreclosure will eventually proceed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term">
                <h3>Chapter 13 Bankruptcy</h3>

                <h3>Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure</h3>
                <p>A transaction where the homeowner voluntarily transfers ownership of the property to the lender in exchange for release from the mortgage debt. This avoids formal foreclosure proceedings and may have less credit impact than a completed foreclosure.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term">
                <h3>Deed of Trust</h3>

                <h3>Deficiency</h3>
                <p>The difference between what you owe on your mortgage and what your home sells for at foreclosure or short sale. California's anti-deficiency laws protect most homeowners from being liable for this amount.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="term">
                <h3>Deficiency Judgment</h3>
                <p>A court order requiring the borrower to pay the deficiency amount. In California, deficiency judgments are prohibited for purchase money loans and any loan foreclosed through non-judicial foreclosure (trustee sale).</p>

            <div class="term">
                <h3>Dual Tracking</h3>
                <p>The illegal practice (in California) of a lender continuing foreclosure proceedings while simultaneously reviewing a homeowner's loan modification application. Prohibited by the California Homeowner Bill of Rights.</p>

                <h3>Equity</h3>
                <p>The difference between your home's current market value and the amount you owe on all mortgages and liens. Positive equity means your home is worth more than you owe; negative equity (being "underwater") means you owe more than it's worth.</p>
                <div class="example"><strong>Example:</strong> If your home is worth $500,000 and you owe $350,000, you have $150,000 in equity.</div>

                <h3>Forbearance</h3>
                <p>A temporary agreement with your lender to reduce or suspend mortgage payments for a specific period. Unlike loan modification, forbearance is temporary and you'll need to repay the missed amounts through a repayment plan, lump sum, or loan modification.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Foreclosure</h3>
                <p>The legal process by which a lender takes ownership of a property after the borrower fails to make mortgage payments. In California, most foreclosures are non-judicial (trustee sale), meaning they don't go through the court system.</p>

                <p>A foreclosure that goes through the court system. Rare in California, where most foreclosures are non-judicial (trustee sale). Judicial foreclosure takes longer but may allow the lender to pursue a deficiency judgment.</p>

                <p>A period after foreclosure sale during which the former owner can reclaim the property by paying the full amount owed. California does NOT have a redemption period for non-judicial foreclosure - once the property is sold at trustee sale, the sale is final.</p>

                <h3>Short Sale</h3>
                <p>A sale of a property for less than the amount owed on the mortgage, with the lender agreeing to accept the proceeds as full satisfaction of the debt. Requires lender approval. Less credit damage than foreclosure and allows you to avoid having foreclosure on your record.</p>
