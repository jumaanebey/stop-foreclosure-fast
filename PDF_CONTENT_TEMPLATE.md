**If They Say "It's Too Late":**
"I understand the sale is scheduled, but I know you have procedures for last-minute modifications and forbearances. I'm prepared to submit all documentation today. Please transfer me to a supervisor or the executive response team."

**Magic Words That Get Attention:**
- "Qualified Written Request under RESPA"
- "Single Point of Contact violation"
- "Dual tracking violation"

**Document Everything:**
"I'm documenting this call. Can I have your name, employee ID, and direct callback number? What's the reference number for this call?"
