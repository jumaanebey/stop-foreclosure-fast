                <h2>California Can Sell Your Home for Unpaid Taxes</h2>
                <p>Even if your mortgage is paid off or you own your home outright, delinquent property taxes can lead to losing your property. But you have 5 years and multiple options before that happens.</p>
            </div>

            <p>If you've fallen behind on property taxes, you're probably receiving alarming letters from the county. It's scary - but here's what you need to know: <strong>California cannot sell your home until taxes have been delinquent for 5 years.</strong> You have time, but you need to act.</p>

            <h2>How Property Tax Delinquency Works in California</h2>

            <div class="timeline-visual">
                <h3>The 5-Year Timeline</h3>

                <div class="timeline-step">

                        <strong>Taxes Become Delinquent</strong><br>
                        10% penalty added after December 10 (1st installment) or April 10 (2nd installment). Property becomes "tax defaulted" after June 30.
                    </div>

                        <strong>Penalties and Interest Accrue</strong><br>
                        1.5% per month (18% annually) added to your balance. County sends annual notices. You can still pay at any time.

                </div>

                    <div class="timeline-year danger">Year 5</div>
                    <div class="timeline-content">
                        <strong>Power to Sell</strong><br>
                        County gains authority to sell your property. You'll receive a Notice of Power to Sell at least 45 days before any sale.

                <p>You can stop this process at ANY point before the sale by paying your delinquent taxes, penalties, and costs. The county WANTS you to pay - they'd rather collect taxes than go through the sale process.</p>

            <h2>What If I Have Both Mortgage AND Tax Problems?</h2>

            <p>Many homeowners facing tax delinquency are also behind on their mortgage. This complicates things:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mortgage escrow:</strong> If your mortgage includes tax escrow, your lender may pay delinquent taxes and add it to your loan balance</li>
                <li><strong>Double jeopardy:</strong> You could face both mortgage foreclosure AND tax sale</li>
                <li><strong>Priority matters:</strong> Property tax liens are superior to mortgage liens - taxes get paid first in any sale</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="danger-box">
                <h4>Important Warning</h4>
                <p>If you're behind on both mortgage AND property taxes, you may need to prioritize. A foreclosure attorney or HUD counselor can help you understand your best strategy. Don't ignore either problem.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>County Tax Collector Contact Information</h2>

            <p>Each county handles its own property taxes. Here are major California counties:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Los Angeles County:</strong> (213) 974-2111 | ttc.lacounty.gov</li>

            <h2>Beware of "Tax Lien" Scams</h2>

            <div class="danger-box">
                <h4>Scam Alert</h4>
                <p>Scammers target people with delinquent taxes. Watch out for: unsolicited offers to "save your home," demands for upfront fees, pressure to sign over your deed, offers that seem too good to be true. Only deal with official county offices or verified, licensed professionals.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>Delinquent property taxes are serious, but you have time and options. California gives you 5 years before the county can sell your home, and there are payment plans and assistance programs available.</p>

            <p>The worst thing you can do is ignore it. Every year you wait, more penalties and interest accumulate. But with the right plan, many homeowners resolve their tax delinquency and keep their homes.</p>

            <p><strong>Start today:</strong> Find out exactly what you owe, check your eligibility for assistance programs, and make a plan. You've got this.</p>
