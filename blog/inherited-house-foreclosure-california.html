However, if you want to KEEP the house, you'll need to either assume the mortgage, refinance, or pay it off. If you don't want the house, you can let it go to foreclosure, sell it (keeping any equity after paying off the mortgage), or do a deed in lieu. The lender cannot come after your personal assets for the mortgage debt."

You can assume the existing mortgage without qualifying for a new loan. Contact the servicer, inform them of the death, provide a death certificate, and request to be added as a 'successor in interest.' You'll keep the same loan terms, which may be beneficial if it's an older loan with a lower interest rate."

To find out: (1) Check for recorded Notice of Default at the county recorder's office, (2) Look through the deceased's mail for foreclosure notices, (3) Contact the loan servicer directly. Even if foreclosure has started, you have options. California foreclosure takes 6-9 months minimum, giving you time to sell, modify, or bring payments current."

            <div class="blog-meta">Your California Options, Explained Simply</div>
        </header>

        <div class="blog-content">
            <div class="inherit-hero">
                <h2>First, Take a Breath</h2>
                <p>Inheriting a house while grieving is overwhelming. You have time to make decisions, and you have more options than you might think. Let's walk through this together.</p>
            </div>

            <p>When you inherit a house with a mortgage, you're suddenly faced with decisions you never expected while dealing with the loss of a loved one. It feels like a burden on top of grief.</p>

            <p>Here's the most important thing to understand right away:</p>

            <div class="key-point">
                <h4>You Don't Automatically Inherit the Debt</h4>
                <p>In California, you are NOT personally responsible for the deceased's mortgage. The debt stays with the property, not you. If you don't want the house, you can walk away without owing anything. If you DO want to keep the house, you have several options.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Your First Steps</h2>

            <div class="step-box">
                <div class="step-number">1</div>
                <div>
                    <strong>Find Out What's Owed</strong><br>
                    Look for mortgage statements in your loved one's paperwork. Contact the loan servicer with the death certificate.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="step-box">
                <div class="step-number">2</div>
                <div>
                    <strong>Check for Foreclosure Status</strong><br>
                    Were payments behind? Look for Notice of Default letters. Check the county recorder for recorded notices.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="step-box">
                <div class="step-number">3</div>
                <div>
                    <strong>Estimate the Property Value</strong><br>
                    Get a rough idea: Zillow estimate, recent neighborhood sales, or ask a real estate agent for a quick assessment.
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="step-box">
                <div class="step-number">4</div>
                <div>
                    <strong>Decide: Keep or Sell?</strong><br>
                    Can you afford payments? Do you want to live there? Would you rent it? Or would selling make more sense?
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>Your Options Explained</h2>

            <div class="option-grid">
                <div class="option-card recommended">
                    <h4>Option 1: Keep the House (Assume the Mortgage)</h4>
                    <p>Federal law lets you take over the existing mortgage without qualifying for a new loan. Keep the same rate and terms.</p>
                    <p class="pros">+ Keep old rate (possibly lower than today's rates)</p>
                    <p class="pros">+ No new loan qualification needed</p>
                    <p class="cons">- Must be able to afford payments</p>
                </div>
                <div class="option-card">
                    <h4>Option 2: Sell the House</h4>
                    <p>Sell the property, pay off the mortgage, and keep any remaining equity. You don't have to be able to afford payments.</p>
                    <p class="pros">+ Walk away with cash if there's equity</p>
                    <p class="pros">+ Clean break from the property</p>
                    <p class="cons">- Takes time to sell traditionally</p>
                </div>
                <div class="option-card">
                    <h4>Option 3: Rent the Property</h4>
                    <p>If the property can rent for more than the mortgage, keep it as an investment and use rent to make payments.</p>
                    <p class="pros">+ Build wealth over time</p>
                    <p class="pros">+ Keep property in family</p>
                    <p class="cons">- Landlord responsibilities</p>
                </div>
                <div class="option-card">
                    <h4>Option 4: Let It Go</h4>
                    <p>If the house is underwater (worth less than owed) or you simply can't/don't want to deal with it, you can walk away.</p>
                    <p class="pros">+ No obligation to pay</p>
                    <p class="pros">+ No personal liability in most cases</p>
                    <p class="cons">- Lose any potential equity</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h2>If There's Equity (House Worth More Than Owed)</h2>

            <p>If your loved one had significant equity, you have a valuable asset. Your priority should be preserving that equity.</p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Act Quickly to Protect Equity</h4>
                <p>If payments aren't being made, the house will eventually go to foreclosure auction. At auction, you lose control and may not get full value for the equity. Selling before auction - even a quick sale - puts YOU in control of the outcome.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Options When There's Equity:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sell traditionally:</strong> List with an agent, get top dollar (but takes 3-6 months)</li>
                <li><strong>Sell to a cash buyer:</strong> Close in weeks, get less but faster (good if foreclosure is looming)</li>
                <li><strong>Assume the mortgage:</strong> Keep the house and the equity, if you can afford payments</li>
                <li><strong>Refinance:</strong> Get a new loan in your name, possibly pull out cash</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>If It's Underwater (Owed More Than It's Worth)</h2>

            <p>If the mortgage balance is higher than the property value, your calculus is different. You have less to lose by walking away.</p>

            <div class="key-point">
                <h4>California is (Mostly) Non-Recourse</h4>
                <p>For purchase-money mortgages on your primary residence, California is a "non-recourse" state. That means even if the house sells for less than owed, the lender typically can't come after you for the difference. (This may not apply to refinances or second homes - consult an attorney if unsure.)</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Options When Underwater:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Walk away:</strong> Let it go to foreclosure - you won't owe the deficiency</li>
                <li><strong>Short sale:</strong> Sell for less than owed with lender approval</li>
                <li><strong>Deed in lieu:</strong> Voluntarily surrender to avoid foreclosure</li>
                <li><strong>Negotiate with lender:</strong> Some may accept less to avoid foreclosure costs</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What About Reverse Mortgages?</h2>

            <p>If your parent had a reverse mortgage (HECM), different rules apply:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>The loan becomes due when the borrower dies or moves out</li>
                <li>You typically have <strong>30 days to respond</strong> to the servicer's notice</li>
                <li>You can request extensions (usually up to 1 year total)</li>
                <li>Reverse mortgages are <strong>non-recourse</strong> - you won't owe more than the house is worth</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Reverse Mortgage Heir Options:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pay off loan, keep house:</strong> Pay the balance or 95% of appraised value (whichever is less)</li>
                <li><strong>Sell the house:</strong> Keep any proceeds above the loan balance</li>
                <li><strong>Deed in lieu:</strong> Walk away if it's underwater</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Is It Already in Foreclosure?</h2>

            <p>If your loved one was behind on payments, foreclosure may have already started. Here's the California timeline:</p>

            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Even if foreclosure has started, you likely have 3-6+ months to act. That's enough time to sell, negotiate, or figure out another option.</p>

            <h2>Common Questions from Heirs</h2>

            <h3>"Do I need to go through probate?"</h3>
            <p>It depends on how the property was titled. If it was in a living trust or held as joint tenancy with right of survivorship, you may avoid probate. Otherwise, you likely need to go through California probate or use a small estate affidavit if the estate qualifies. Consult a probate attorney for your specific situation.</p>

            <h3>"How long do I have to make a decision?"</h3>
            <p>If payments are current, you have time. If payments have stopped, the foreclosure clock is ticking. Most heirs have 3-9 months from the first missed payment to make decisions, but acting sooner gives you more options.</p>

            <h3>"Can I sell the house before probate is finished?"</h3>
            <p>In California, you may be able to sell with court confirmation during probate. Some situations allow for simpler transfers. A probate attorney or title company can advise on your specific case.</p>

            <h3>"What if multiple heirs inherited the property?"</h3>
            <p>All heirs generally need to agree on what to do. If you can't agree, you may need to petition the court for a partition sale. This is a common and unfortunately complicated situation - try to reach agreement if possible.</p>

            <h2>Remember: You Have Options</h2>

            <p>Inheriting a house with a mortgage can feel like inheriting a problem. But it doesn't have to be. Whether there's equity to preserve, a foreclosure to navigate, or a decision to make about keeping vs. selling, there are paths forward.</p>

            <p>Take it one step at a time. Get the information you need. And remember - you don't have to figure this out alone.</p>
