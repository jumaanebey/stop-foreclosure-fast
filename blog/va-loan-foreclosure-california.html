                <h2>To Every Veteran Reading This</h2>
                <p>You're not alone. Thousands of California veterans face mortgage trouble every year - and most find solutions. Your VA loan comes with protections and programs specifically designed to help you. Let's explore your options.</p>
            </div>

            <p>If you're a veteran or active service member struggling with your VA loan payments, you have <strong>more options than civilian borrowers</strong>. The VA genuinely wants to help you keep your home, and they have programs and people dedicated to making that happen.</p>

            <p>This guide covers everything California veterans need to know about VA loan foreclosure - your unique protections, specific programs available, and exactly who to call for help.</p>

            <h2>Your VA-Specific Protections</h2>

            <div class="protection-box">
                <h4>The VA Fights For You</h4>
                <p>Unlike conventional loans, the VA requires servicers to make extensive efforts to help you avoid foreclosure. They must evaluate you for ALL loss mitigation options before proceeding. The VA assigns loan technicians specifically to advocate for veterans in default.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)</h3>
            <p>If you're on active duty, the SCRA provides powerful protections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>6% Interest Rate Cap:</strong> For loans taken before active duty service</li>
                <li><strong>Court Approval Required:</strong> Lender must get court permission to foreclose</li>
                <li><strong>90-Day Stay:</strong> Court can delay proceedings while you're deployed</li>
                <li><strong>Post-Service Protection:</strong> Some protections extend after you leave active duty</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>California Homeowner Bill of Rights</h3>
            <p>As a California homeowner, you also get state protections including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Single point of contact at your servicer</li>
                <li>Right to request loan modification before foreclosure</li>
                <li>Prohibition on "dual tracking" (foreclosure during modification review)</li>
                <li>Required face-to-face meeting attempts</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>VA Foreclosure Prevention Programs</h2>

            <div class="program-grid">
                <div class="program-card">
                    <h4>VA Loan Modification</h4>
                    <p>Permanently change your loan terms - lower interest rate, extend term, or capitalize past-due amounts to reduce monthly payments.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="program-card">
                    <h4>VA Repayment Plan</h4>
                    <p>Add small amounts to your regular payment over time to catch up on missed payments without a lump sum.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="program-card">
                    <h4>VA Special Forbearance</h4>
                    <p>Temporarily reduce or suspend payments while you recover from financial hardship. Especially helpful during unemployment or medical crisis.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="program-card">
                    <h4>VA Compromise Sale</h4>
                    <p>VA-approved short sale. Sell your home for less than you owe with VA approval. Often better than foreclosure for protecting your entitlement.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="va-resource">
                <h4>VA Regional Loan Center</h4>
                <p>Call the VA directly for foreclosure help:</p>
                <a href="tel:1-877-827-3702">1-877-827-3702</a>
                <p style="margin-top: 8px; font-size: 14px;">They can assign a loan technician to your case and intervene with your servicer.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Protecting Your VA Loan Entitlement</h2>

            <p>Your VA loan entitlement is valuable - it's what allows you to buy a home with no down payment. <strong>Foreclosure can reduce or eliminate your remaining entitlement</strong>, making it harder to use your VA benefit again.</p>

            <p>Options that typically protect your entitlement better than foreclosure:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sell before foreclosure:</strong> If you have equity, a regular sale preserves full entitlement</li>
                <li><strong>VA Compromise Sale:</strong> Short sale with VA approval - better for entitlement than foreclosure</li>
                <li><strong>Assumption:</strong> Another veteran assumes your loan</li>
                <li><strong>Loan modification:</strong> Keep your home and entitlement</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What to Do Right Now</h2>

            <h2>You Served. We Want to Help.</h2>

            <p>Financial trouble doesn't erase your service or your sacrifice. Many veterans face mortgage challenges due to circumstances beyond their control - transition difficulties, service-connected disabilities, deployment impacts on family finances.</p>

            <p>The programs and protections exist because you've earned them. Use them. Ask for help. That's not weakness - it's the smart tactical move.</p>

            <p><strong>Don't let pride cost you your home.</strong> Pick up the phone, call the VA, call a counselor, or call us. The first step is the hardest, but there are people waiting to help on the other end of that call.</p>
