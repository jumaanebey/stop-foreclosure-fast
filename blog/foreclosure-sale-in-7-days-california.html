Options include: filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy (creates immediate automatic stay), loan reinstatement (paying all past-due amounts), emergency cash sale to an investor, or in some cases requesting a postponement from the trustee. Time is critical - call a professional immediately at (949) 565-5285."

However, this is a significant legal step with long-term implications. You'll need a bankruptcy attorney who can file emergency paperwork quickly. The automatic stay stops the sale while you reorganize your debts over 3-5 years."

If you have equity, selling preserves that equity and keeps foreclosure off your credit. Contact a foreclosure specialist immediately to explore quick sale options."

            <h2>Your Emergency Options with 7 Days or Less</h2>

            <p>When your foreclosure sale is just days away, you need to act immediately. Here are your realistic options:</p>

            <div class="option-urgent">
                <h3>Option 1: Emergency Bankruptcy Filing (Immediate Stop)</h3>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Can be filed same-day in emergencies</p>
                <p>Filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy creates an <strong>automatic stay</strong> that legally stops the foreclosure sale immediately - even the day before auction. This is often the fastest way to stop a sale.</p>
                <p><strong>What you need:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Bankruptcy attorney who handles emergency filings</li>
                    <li>Filing fee (approximately $300) or fee waiver</li>
                    <li>Basic financial information</li>
                    <li>Proof of income</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> This is a serious legal step with 7-year credit impact. But it keeps your home and gives you 3-5 years to catch up on payments.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="option-urgent">
                <h3>Option 2: Loan Reinstatement (Pay to Cure)</h3>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Must complete 5 business days before sale</p>
                <p>California law gives you the right to reinstate your loan by paying all past-due amounts until 5 business days before the sale. If you can access the funds, this stops foreclosure completely.</p>

                <div class="step-box">
                    <div class="step-number">1</div>
                    <div><strong>Call your servicer immediately</strong> - Request a reinstatement quote with the exact amount needed</div>
                </div>
                <div class="step-box">
                    <div class="step-number">2</div>
                    <div><strong>Arrange funds</strong> - 401(k) withdrawal, family loan, hard money loan, or home equity</div>
                </div>
                <div class="step-box">
                    <div class="step-number">3</div>
                    <div><strong>Wire the payment</strong> - Personal checks won't clear in time; wire transfer required</div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="option-urgent">
                <h3>Option 3: Emergency Cash Sale (5-7 Days)</h3>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> Can close in 5-7 days with cash buyer</p>
                <p>If you have equity in your home, selling to a cash buyer before the auction lets you:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keep your equity (instead of losing it at auction)</li>
                    <li>Avoid foreclosure on your credit report</li>
                    <li>Walk away with cash for a fresh start</li>
                    <li>Control the process on your terms</li>

                <h3>Option 4: Request Postponement from Trustee</h3>
                <p><strong>Timeline:</strong> No guarantee, but worth trying</p>
                <p>In some cases, the trustee or lender may agree to postpone the sale, especially if:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You have a pending loan modification application</li>
                    <li>You've recently made a payment or partial payment</li>
                    <li>You're in active negotiations on a short sale</li>
                    <li>There are title issues or legal complications</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is not guaranteed, but contacting the trustee listed on your Notice of Sale is worth trying while pursuing other options.</p>

            <h2>What NOT to Do When Foreclosure is Days Away</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>DON'T ignore it</strong> - Hoping it will go away guarantees you lose your home</li>
                <li><strong>DON'T fall for scams</strong> - Never pay upfront fees to someone promising to "save" your home</li>
                <li><strong>DON'T deed your property to a stranger</strong> - This is a common scam</li>
                <li><strong>DON'T assume it's too late</strong> - People stop foreclosure at the last minute every day</li>
                <li><strong>DON'T wait until the day before</strong> - Even emergency options need some time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Happens If You Do Nothing?</h2>

            <p>If the foreclosure sale proceeds:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Your home will be sold to the highest bidder at public auction</li>
                <li>You lose all ownership rights immediately</li>
                <li>You must vacate the property (eviction if necessary)</li>
                <li>Foreclosure stays on your credit report for <strong>7 years</strong></li>
                <li>You may not be able to buy another home for <strong>3-7 years</strong></li>
                <li>Any equity you built is typically lost (excess proceeds rarely returned promptly)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Can I stop foreclosure if the sale is in 7 days?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes, you may still be able to stop foreclosure. Options include filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy (immediate automatic stay), loan reinstatement (if you can pay all past-due amounts), emergency cash sale to an investor, or requesting a postponement. Time is critical - you need to act today.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Can I file bankruptcy the day before foreclosure?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes, filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy creates an automatic stay that stops foreclosure immediately, even if filed the day before auction. You'll need a bankruptcy attorney who handles emergency filings. This should be a last resort given the long-term implications, but it works.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How much money do I need to reinstate my mortgage?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The reinstatement amount includes all missed payments plus late fees, attorney fees, trustee fees, and costs. This typically ranges from $10,000 to $50,000+ depending on how far behind you are. Contact your servicer immediately for an exact reinstatement quote.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Can I sell my house with only 7 days before foreclosure?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes, but only to a cash buyer. Traditional sales take 30-60 days. Cash investors can close in 5-7 days. If you have equity, this lets you keep that equity and avoid foreclosure on your credit. Call us for a cash offer within 24 hours.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What happens to my equity if the house is foreclosed?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">At foreclosure auction, your home often sells below market value. While California law requires excess proceeds be returned to you, this process is slow and complicated. Selling before foreclosure typically preserves more of your equity and gives you immediate access to funds.</div>
