Many homeowners successfully keep their homes after job loss by: using forbearance to pause payments during job search, finding new employment and getting a loan modification, using savings strategically, or getting temporary help from family. The key is communicating with your lender early and exploring all options. Foreclosure happens when people ignore the problem."

                <p><strong>Take a breath.</strong> Losing your job is terrifying, especially when you have a mortgage. But people get through this every day. There are programs designed exactly for this situation. You have more options than you think - and more time than you fear.</p>
            </div>

            <p>If you've lost your job and are worried about making your mortgage payment, you're not alone. <strong>Job loss is one of the most common reasons people fall behind on their mortgage</strong> - and lenders know this. That's why most have programs to help.</p>

            <p>Here's what you need to know and exactly what to do.</p>

            <div class="first-48">
                <h3>Your First 48 Hours: Action Plan</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>File for unemployment benefits TODAY</strong> - California EDD benefits provide income while you job search. Don't delay.</li>
                    <li><strong>Call your mortgage servicer</strong> - Tell them you've lost your job. Ask about forbearance or hardship programs. Do this BEFORE you miss a payment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Review your finances</strong> - How many months can you cover with savings? What expenses can you cut immediately?</li>
                    <li><strong>Check if you qualify for California Mortgage Relief</strong> - Up to $80,000 available for eligible homeowners.</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't panic-sell or make major decisions yet</strong> - You have time. Get information first.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>

            <h2>What Is Forbearance (And Why You Need to Ask for It)</h2>

            <p>Forbearance is a temporary agreement with your lender to <strong>reduce or pause your mortgage payments</strong> while you're experiencing hardship. It's not forgiveness - you'll need to repay the missed amounts eventually - but it buys you crucial time.</p>

            <p><strong>How forbearance helps after job loss:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Payments paused for 3-12 months while you find new work</li>
                <li>No foreclosure proceedings during forbearance</li>
                <li>Less credit damage than missed payments</li>
                <li>Once employed again, you can work out a repayment plan or modification</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>To get forbearance:</strong> Call your loan servicer (the company you make payments to) and ask for the "loss mitigation" or "hardship" department. Explain that you've lost your job and need temporary relief.</p>

            <h2>Help Available in California</h2>

            <div class="help-card">
                <h4>California Mortgage Relief Program</h4>
                <p>If you experienced hardship due to COVID-19, you may qualify for up to <strong>$80,000</strong> to cover past-due mortgage payments, property taxes, and other housing costs. This is grant money - you don't pay it back.</p>
                <p><strong>Apply at:</strong> CaMortgageRelief.org or call 1-888-840-2594</p>
            </div>

            <div class="help-card">
                <h4>California Unemployment Insurance (EDD)</h4>
                <p>Provides weekly income while you search for work. Maximum benefit is $450/week for up to 26 weeks. File immediately - there's a waiting period.</p>
                <p><strong>Apply at:</strong> EDD.ca.gov</p>
            </div>

            <div class="help-card">
                <h4>Free Housing Counseling</h4>
                <p>HUD-approved counselors can help you understand your options, apply for assistance, and communicate with your lender - all for free.</p>
                <p><strong>Call:</strong> 1-800-569-4287 or visit HUD.gov</p>
            </div>

            <h2>What NOT to Do After Losing Your Job</h2>

            <div class="dont-box">
                <h4>Avoid These Mistakes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Don't ignore your lender</strong> - They have programs to help, but only if you ask</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't drain retirement accounts</strong> - 401(k)s have legal protections; your house doesn't in bankruptcy</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't use credit cards to pay the mortgage</strong> - This creates more debt with high interest</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't wait until you're months behind</strong> - Early intervention = more options</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't assume you'll lose the house</strong> - Most people who act early keep their homes</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Your Timeline: How Long Before Foreclosure?</h2>

            <p>Even if you miss payments, foreclosure doesn't happen overnight in California:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Day 1-30:</strong> Grace period, then late fee</li>
                <li><strong>Day 30+:</strong> Reported to credit bureaus</li>
                <li><strong>Day 120+:</strong> Lender can file Notice of Default</li>
                <li><strong>Day 210+:</strong> Notice of Sale can be recorded</li>
                <li><strong>Day 230+:</strong> Earliest possible auction date</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's 7+ months from first missed payment to potential auction - and most take longer. <strong>You have time, but don't waste it.</strong></p>

            <h2>When You Find a New Job</h2>

            <p>Once you're employed again, you have several options to address missed payments:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repayment plan:</strong> Pay extra each month until you're caught up</li>
                <li><strong>Loan modification:</strong> Permanently lower your payment if the new job pays less</li>
                <li><strong>Lump sum:</strong> Pay all missed amounts at once (rarely practical)</li>
                <li><strong>Partial claim:</strong> Some loans allow missed payments to be added to end of loan</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>If You Can't Find Work / Can't Afford the House</h2>

            <p>Sometimes the math just doesn't work. If you genuinely can't afford your home anymore, it's better to make that decision proactively than to face foreclosure:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sell the house</strong> - If you have equity, selling lets you keep that equity and avoid foreclosure</li>
                <li><strong>Short sale</strong> - If you owe more than it's worth, lender may accept less than owed</li>
                <li><strong>Deed in lieu</strong> - Voluntarily transfer ownership to avoid foreclosure process</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Any of these options is better for your credit and future than a completed foreclosure.</p>
