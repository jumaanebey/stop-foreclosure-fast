Under California Civil Code Section 5700, if your delinquent assessments (excluding late fees, interest, and collection costs) exceed $1,800 OR are more than 12 months delinquent, the HOA can record a lien and proceed with non-judicial foreclosure.

Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows you to catch up on delinquent HOA dues over 3-5 years while keeping your home.

Consult a bankruptcy attorney to understand which option is best for your situation."

In California, mortgage liens typically have priority over HOA liens (except for certain super-lien provisions). If your mortgage lender forecloses first, the HOA lien is usually wiped out. If the HOA forecloses first, the mortgage stays attached to the property. This complexity is why you should consult with a professional to develop a strategy that protects your interests."

HOAs often prefer payment plans over foreclosure because foreclosure is expensive and time-consuming for them too."

                <h2>Yes, HOAs Can Foreclose in California</h2>
                <p>But it's a long process with many protections for homeowners. If you're behind on HOA dues, here's what you need to know to protect yourself.</p>
            </div>

            <p>It shocks many California homeowners to learn that their HOA can foreclose on their home - even if their mortgage is completely paid off. But before you panic, understand that <strong>HOA foreclosure is a lengthy process</strong> with significant legal protections for you.</p>

            <div class="key-fact">
                <h4>When Can an HOA Foreclose in California?</h4>
                <p>Under California Civil Code Section 5700, an HOA can only pursue foreclosure if your delinquent regular assessments (NOT including late fees, interest, or collection costs) either exceed <strong>$1,800</strong> or have been delinquent for more than <strong>12 months</strong>. Both thresholds are high bars that give you time to act.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The HOA Foreclosure Timeline</h2>

            <div class="timeline-box">
                <h3>From Missed Payment to Foreclosure Sale</h3>

                <div class="timeline-step">

                        Late fees begin accruing. HOA may send reminder notices.
                    </div>

                <div class="timeline-step">
                    <div>
                        <strong>Day 30+: Pre-Lien Notice Required</strong><br>
                        HOA must send itemized statement of amounts owed and notify you of your right to request a payment plan and alternative dispute resolution.
                    </div>
                </div>

                        If you don't respond or can't reach agreement, HOA can record a lien against your property.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline-step">

                        <strong>30+ Days After Lien: Notice of Default</strong><br>
                        HOA must wait at least 30 days after recording lien before starting foreclosure. Then they must record Notice of Default.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="timeline-step">
                    <div>
                        <strong>90 Days: Reinstatement Period</strong><br>
                        You have at least 90 days to pay the full amount owed (including fees and costs) to stop the foreclosure.
                    </div>
                </div>

                        After reinstatement period, HOA can schedule auction with at least 21 days notice.
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Total timeline:</strong> Typically 6-12 months minimum from first missed payment to foreclosure sale. This gives you time to find a solution.</p>

                <div class="rights-card">
                    <h4>Right to Payment Plan</h4>
                    <p>Before recording a lien, the HOA MUST offer you the opportunity to request a payment plan that spreads your balance over at least 12 months.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="rights-card">
                    <h4>Right to Dispute Resolution</h4>

                    <h4>Right to Detailed Statement</h4>

                <div class="rights-card">
                    <h4>Right to Reinstate</h4>

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="protection-box">
                <h4>Special Protection for Seniors and Disabled Homeowners</h4>
                <p>California law requires HOAs to consider hardship circumstances. If you're a senior or disabled person facing HOA foreclosure, you may have additional protections. Document your circumstances and communicate them to the HOA board in writing.</p>
            </div>

                    HOAs often make procedural errors. Were all required notices sent? Were proper waiting periods observed? Errors can void the foreclosure.

                    Filing bankruptcy immediately stops HOA foreclosure. Chapter 13 lets you catch up over 3-5 years while keeping your home.

            <h2>What About Your Mortgage?</h2>

            <p>If you have a mortgage and are behind on HOA dues, the situation is complex:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Most mortgage liens have priority</strong> over HOA liens (they were recorded first)</li>
                <li><strong>If the mortgage lender forecloses first</strong>, the HOA lien is typically wiped out</li>
                <li><strong>If the HOA forecloses first</strong>, the new owner takes the property subject to the mortgage</li>
                <li><strong>Your mortgage lender may pay</strong> delinquent HOA dues to protect their interest (and add it to your loan)</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="danger-box">
                <h4>Warning: Super Lien Provisions</h4>
                <p>California gives HOAs a limited "super lien" for up to 12 months of assessments. This portion can have priority over some mortgages in certain circumstances. The rules are complex - if you're facing this situation, consult with an attorney.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Negotiating with Your HOA</h2>

            <p>Remember: <strong>HOAs don't actually want to foreclose.</strong> Foreclosure is expensive, time-consuming, and creates problems for the community. Most boards would rather work something out.</p>

            <h3>Tips for Negotiating:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Request a meeting with the board (not just the management company)</li>
                <li>Explain your hardship circumstances honestly</li>
                <li>Propose a specific payment plan you can actually afford</li>
                <li>Ask them to waive late fees and interest as part of any agreement</li>
                <li>Get EVERYTHING in writing</li>

            <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Yes, California HOAs can foreclose - but it takes 6-12+ months</li>
                <li>You have strong rights including payment plans and dispute resolution</li>
                <li>The threshold is $1,800 in assessments OR 12 months delinquent</li>
                <li>Don't ignore notices - respond in writing to protect your rights</li>
                <li>HOAs usually prefer to work out payment plans over foreclosure</li>
                <li>Bankruptcy can stop HOA foreclosure immediately if needed</li>
                <li>If procedures weren't followed properly, the foreclosure may be voidable</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You have more time and more options than you think. But the sooner you act, the better your options will be.</p>
