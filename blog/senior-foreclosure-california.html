                <h2>You've Worked Your Whole Life for This Home</h2>
                <p>You shouldn't lose it now. California has programs and protections specifically for seniors facing foreclosure. Let's explore your options together.</p>
            </div>

            <p>If you're a senior homeowner in California facing foreclosure, know this: <strong>you have options, and people want to help you.</strong> Whether you're struggling with a traditional mortgage, reverse mortgage issues, or property tax problems, there are programs designed specifically for situations like yours.</p>

            <p>This guide will walk you through everything in clear, simple terms. And if you have family helping you navigate this, there's information for them too.</p>

            <h2>Common Reasons Seniors Face Foreclosure</h2>

            <p>You're not alone, and there's no shame in this situation. Here's what brings many seniors to this point:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed income not keeping up with costs:</strong> Social Security and pensions don't increase like property taxes and insurance</li>
                <li><strong>Loss of a spouse:</strong> Losing the income and help of a partner</li>
                <li><strong>Medical expenses:</strong> Healthcare costs consuming retirement savings</li>
                <li><strong>Reverse mortgage issues:</strong> Property tax or insurance defaults</li>
                <li><strong>Predatory lending:</strong> Being talked into loans you didn't fully understand</li>
                <li><strong>Scam victimization:</strong> Seniors are often targeted by financial scammers</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Programs That Can Help California Seniors</h2>

            <div class="protection-grid">
                <div class="protection-card">
                    <h4>California Mortgage Relief</h4>
                    <p>Up to $80,000 in assistance for eligible homeowners. Can cover past-due payments and bring your mortgage current.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="protection-card">
                    <h4>Senior Property Tax Postponement</h4>
                    <p>California seniors 62+ with household income under $49,017 can postpone property taxes until they sell or move.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="protection-card">
                    <h4>Loan Modification</h4>
                    <p>Permanently reduce your monthly payment through lower rates or extended terms. Your servicer must evaluate you for this.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="protection-card">
                    <h4>Free Legal Aid</h4>
                    <p>Legal aid organizations provide free representation to qualifying seniors. They can negotiate with lenders on your behalf.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="resource-box">
                <h4>HUD-Approved Housing Counselors</h4>
                <p>Free help from trained counselors who work for YOU, not the bank.</p>
                <a href="tel:1-800-569-4287">1-800-569-4287</a>
                <p style="margin-top: 8px; font-size: 14px;">Available in multiple languages</p>
            </div>

            <h2>If You Have a Reverse Mortgage</h2>

            <p>Reverse mortgages (HECMs) eliminate monthly mortgage payments, but <strong>you can still face foreclosure</strong> if you don't:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Pay your property taxes</li>
                <li>Keep homeowner's insurance current</li>
                <li>Maintain the property</li>
                <li>Live in the home as your primary residence</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Reverse Mortgage Warning Signs</h4>
                <p>If you've received letters about property tax defaults or insurance lapses, act immediately. HUD requires servicers to work with you on solutions before foreclosure, but you must respond to their communications.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Reverse Mortgage Help Options</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Property charge payment plan:</strong> Catch up on taxes/insurance over time</li>
                <li><strong>California Property Tax Postponement:</strong> Defer taxes until you sell</li>
                <li><strong>At-risk extension:</strong> More time if you're actively working on a solution</li>
                <li><strong>Sale before foreclosure:</strong> Keep any equity above what you owe</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>If Your Spouse Passed Away</h2>

            <p>Losing your spouse is devastating. Losing your home on top of that shouldn't happen. Here's what you need to know:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>You cannot be foreclosed on</strong> simply because your spouse died - this is federal law</li>
                <li><strong>You can assume the mortgage</strong> even without qualifying traditionally</li>
                <li><strong>Request to be added as a "successor in interest"</strong> with your servicer</li>
                <li><strong>You may qualify for loan modification</strong> based on your current income</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Contact your loan servicer immediately after your spouse's death. Tell them you're the surviving spouse and want to keep the home. Request information about your successor-in-interest rights.</p>

            <h2>Protecting Yourself from Scams</h2>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>Beware of "Foreclosure Rescue" Scams</h4>
                <p>Scammers target seniors facing foreclosure. Never pay upfront fees for foreclosure help. Never sign over your deed. Never make payments to anyone other than your official servicer. Legitimate housing counselors are free (HUD-approved). When in doubt, call the HUD hotline: 1-800-569-4287.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Your California Protections</h2>

            <p>California law provides important protections for all homeowners, with extra consideration for seniors:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single Point of Contact:</strong> One person at your servicer who knows your case</li>
                <li><strong>Modification Review Required:</strong> Must be evaluated before foreclosure proceeds</li>
                <li><strong>No Dual Tracking:</strong> Can't foreclose while your modification is under review</li>
                <li><strong>Elder Abuse Laws:</strong> Legal recourse if you were deceived into a predatory loan</li>
                <li><strong>Court Consideration:</strong> Judges may give extra weight to senior housing stability in eviction cases</li>
            </ul>

                <h3>For Family Members Helping an Elderly Parent</h3>

                    <li><strong>Consider options:</strong> Would your parent be better off living closer to family? Would you be able to help with payments?</li>
                    <li><strong>Act quickly:</strong> Foreclosure timelines don't wait for families to make decisions</li>
