Many people think foreclosure happens overnight - it doesn't! California's process typically takes 200-300 days, giving you time to explore options.

📄 **Day 90+:** Notice of Default filed
📋 **Day 180+:** Notice of Sale issued  
🏛️ **Day 200+:** Auction scheduled

**The key?** Don't wait until the last minute. The earlier you act, the more options you have.
