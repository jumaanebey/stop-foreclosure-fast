**Based on your interest, here's what I recommend:**

**If you're currently facing foreclosure:**
- Review the checklist to understand where you are in the process

- Contact me at (949) 328-4811 for a free consultation

**If you're just getting informed:**
- Keep the checklist handy for future reference
- Share it with anyone you know who might need help
- Follow up with any questions you might have

**Common questions I get after people read the checklist:**
1. "How much time do I really have?"
2. "What's my best option given my specific situation?"
3. "Can you really close in 7 days?"

Happy to answer any of these for you personally.

**Free consultation available:** (949) 328-4811
