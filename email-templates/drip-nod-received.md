**Subject Line:** You Have 90 Days - Here's Exactly What Happens Next
**Preview Text:** The NOD is scary, but you have more time than you think. Here's your timeline.

Hi {{first_name}},

I know receiving that Notice of Default feels like the world is ending. I've helped hundreds of California homeowners in your exact situation, and I want you to know one thing first:

**You have time. And you have options.**

Under California law (Civil Code 2924), here's what your timeline actually looks like:

**Your 90-Day NOD Period:**
- Days 1-30: Lender must wait before taking further action
- Days 31-60: You can still reinstate your loan by catching up on payments
- Days 61-90: Final window before Notice of Sale can be recorded

**What this means for you:** The foreclosure auction cannot happen for at least 110 days from your NOD date. Most take 4-6 months.

I'm not here to pressure you. I'm here to make sure you understand every option available - whether that's keeping your home, selling on your terms, or walking away with cash in your pocket.

**Your next step:** Reply to this email with your NOD date, and I'll send you a personalized timeline showing exactly how much time you have.

## Email 2: 3 Things to Do This Week

**Send:** Day 3
**Subject Line:** Do These 3 Things This Week (Takes 2 Hours Total)
**Preview Text:** Simple action steps that protect your rights and buy you more time.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

It's been a few days since you got that Notice of Default. By now, the initial shock might be wearing off, and you're probably wondering: "What do I actually DO?"

Here are 3 things to handle this week:

**1. Gather Your Paperwork (30 minutes)**
Find these documents and put them in one folder:
- Your original mortgage/deed of trust
- Recent mortgage statements
- The Notice of Default you received
- Any other letters from your lender

**2. Know Your Equity (15 minutes)**
Check your home's approximate value on Zillow or Redfin. Subtract what you owe. This number determines which options make sense for you.

**3. Understand Your Rights (30 minutes)**
California's Homeowner Bill of Rights gives you powerful protections:
- Lenders must provide a single point of contact
- You must receive information about foreclosure alternatives
- Dual tracking (foreclosing while reviewing your modification) is illegal

**Why this matters:** These steps take less than 2 hours but give you clarity and control. Most homeowners in foreclosure feel paralyzed because they don't know where to start.

Now you do.

**Quick question:** Have you calculated your equity yet? If your home is worth more than you owe, you have options most people don't know about. Reply and let me know - I'll explain what's possible.

## Email 3: Understanding Your Options Before Notice of Sale

**Send:** Day 7
**Subject Line:** Before the Notice of Sale Arrives - Know Your 4 Options
**Preview Text:** Each path has pros and cons. Here's the honest breakdown.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

One week into your NOD period. You're doing the right thing by staying informed.

Before the Notice of Sale is recorded (which can happen after day 90), you have four main paths:

**Option 1: Loan Modification**
- What it is: Renegotiating your loan terms with your lender
- Pros: Keep your home, potentially lower payments
- Cons: Long process, no guarantee of approval, your debt remains
- Best for: Homeowners with stable income who can afford modified payments

**Option 2: Reinstatement**
- What it is: Paying all missed payments plus fees to get current
- Pros: Stops foreclosure immediately, keep your home
- Cons: Requires significant cash on hand
- Best for: Homeowners who had temporary hardship but are now stable

**Option 3: Short Sale**
- What it is: Selling for less than you owe (lender approves the loss)
- Pros: Avoid foreclosure on your record, walk away clean
- Cons: Takes 3-6 months, credit impact, may owe taxes on forgiven debt
- Best for: Homeowners who are underwater and can't afford the home

**Option 4: Cash Sale to Investor**
- What it is: Selling quickly to a company like ours for cash
- Pros: Close in as little as 14 days, no repairs needed, often walk away with cash
- Cons: Typically below market value
- Best for: Homeowners with equity who need speed and certainty

**The honest truth:** There's no single "best" option. It depends on your equity, your timeline, and what matters most to you.

## Email 4: Quick Cash Offer vs Traditional Sale - Comparison

**Send:** Day 14
**Subject Line:** Cash Offer vs. Listing With an Agent - The Real Numbers
**Preview Text:** I'm going to show you exactly what each option looks like for a $500K home.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

Two weeks in. You've probably been getting calls from real estate agents offering to list your home. Maybe you're wondering if that's better than a cash offer.

Let me break down the real numbers:

**Example: $500,000 Home Value**

**Traditional Sale with Agent:**
- List price: $500,000
- Agent commission (5-6%): -$27,500
- Closing costs (2-3%): -$12,500
- Repairs/staging: -$10,000 (average)
- Time on market: 30-90 days
- Closing process: 30-45 days
- **Net to you: ~$450,000**
- **Total timeline: 60-135 days**

**Cash Sale to Investor:**
- Offer: $425,000-$450,000 (85-90% of value)
- Commission: $0
- Closing costs: $0 (we pay)
- Repairs: $0 (we buy as-is)
- Time to close: 14-21 days
- **Net to you: $425,000-$450,000**
- **Total timeline: 14-21 days**

**The real difference:** When you factor in commissions, closing costs, and repairs, the net numbers are often closer than you'd think. But the timeline difference is massive.

**When a cash offer makes more sense:**
- Your auction date is approaching
- You can't afford repairs or mortgage payments while listed
- You need certainty (no buyers backing out)
- You're dealing with a difficult property (probate, divorce, damage)

**When listing makes more sense:**
- You have 4+ months before any deadline
- Your home is in great condition
- You can afford to wait for the right buyer

**Want to see what a cash offer looks like for YOUR property?** No obligation, no pressure. Takes 5 minutes.

## Email 5: Halfway Point Check-in

**Send:** Day 21
**Subject Line:** Day 45 Update: Where Are You At?
**Preview Text:** Checking in - have you made any decisions? I'm here if you need to talk.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

It's been about three weeks since your Notice of Default. You're approaching the halfway point of your NOD period.

I wanted to check in and see where you're at.

**Have you:**
- [ ] Talked to your lender about modification options?
- [ ] Gotten an estimate of your home's value?
- [ ] Explored whether a cash sale might work for your situation?

**I've seen three types of homeowners at this stage:**

**The "I'm working on it" group:** You've contacted your lender, maybe applied for a modification, and you're waiting to hear back. Smart move - just don't let the waiting become inaction.

**The "I need more time to think" group:** Totally understandable. This is a big decision. Just remember - the clock is ticking, and your options decrease as time passes.

**The "I don't know where to start" group:** That's okay too. Sometimes the overwhelm is the hardest part. One conversation can change everything.

**Here's what I want you to know:**

In about 60-70 days, your lender can record a Notice of Sale. Once that happens, you'll have about 21 days until auction. The window for solutions gets much smaller.

Right now, you have time. You have options. But only if you use them.

**If you've been putting off that conversation, let's have it today.**

Schedule a 15-minute call: {{calendar_link}}

Or just reply to this email with "CALL ME" and I'll reach out directly.

No pitch. Just honest advice about your specific situation.
