# Auction Scheduled - 5-Email Drip Sequence

**Trigger:** Lead has auction date set (Notice of Sale recorded)
**Audience:** California homeowners facing imminent foreclosure auction
**Goal:** Create urgency without panic, convert to fast consultation and cash offer
**Timeline:** Compressed 10-day sequence (auctions typically 21 days after NOS)

## Email 1: Auction Scheduled - You Still Have Options

**Send:** Day 0 (immediately after identifying auction date)
**Subject Line:** Your Auction Date is Set - But It's NOT Over
**Preview Text:** {{auction_date}} is your deadline. Here's what you can still do.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

I know you've just learned your home is scheduled for auction on **{{auction_date}}**. That news hits hard.

But I need you to hear this clearly: **The auction date is NOT the end of your options.**

Under California law, you can stop the foreclosure process right up until the auction begins. I've helped homeowners close deals literally days before their auction date.

**What's still possible right now:**

1. **Sell your home for cash** - We can close in as little as 7-14 days, even with an auction date pending
2. **Reinstate your loan** - Pay the total amount owed to stop the sale (if you have the funds)
3. **File bankruptcy** - This immediately stops the auction (though it has long-term consequences)
4. **Negotiate with your lender** - Some lenders will postpone if you have a pending sale

**The difference between success and foreclosure at this stage is speed.**

Every day that passes reduces your options. But right now, today, you still have choices.

**I want to talk to you today.** Not to pressure you - but because time is the one thing we can't get back.

**Call me now:** {{phone_number}}

Or schedule an urgent call: {{calendar_link}}

I've helped dozens of homeowners in your exact situation walk away with money in their pocket instead of a foreclosure on their record. Let's see if I can help you.

## Email 2: How We Can Close Before Your Auction Date

**Send:** Day 2
**Subject Line:** Here's How We Close in 14 Days (Before {{auction_date}})
**Preview Text:** The exact process we use to beat auction deadlines.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

You have **{{days_until_auction}} days** until your auction date. That's tight, but we've closed in less.

Here's exactly how we get it done:

**Our 14-Day Close Process:**

**Days 1-2: Property Evaluation**
- We review your property details
- No inspections needed upfront
- We make you a cash offer within 24-48 hours

**Days 3-5: Title Work**
- We order title and begin clearing any liens
- You review and sign the purchase agreement
- We handle all paperwork

**Days 6-12: Closing Preparation**
- Title company prepares closing documents
- We coordinate with your lender to get payoff figures
- No waiting on bank approvals (we're paying cash)

**Days 13-14: You Get Paid**
- Sign closing documents
- Lender gets paid off
- You receive remaining funds (often same day)

**Why this works when other solutions don't:**
- No bank financing = no loan approval delays
- No contingencies = no deals falling through
- Direct buyer = no agent coordination

**Real example:** Last month, we closed on a home in Riverside 11 days before the auction. The homeowner walked away with $47,000 that would have been lost to foreclosure.

**Your auction is {{auction_date}}. We can still do this.**

## Email 3: What Happens If You Don't Act

**Send:** Day 5
**Subject Line:** After {{auction_date}}: What Foreclosure Really Means
**Preview Text:** The financial and legal consequences - and how to avoid them.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

I don't want to scare you. But I do need you to understand what happens if we run out of time.

**If your home sells at auction:**

**Immediate consequences:**
- You must vacate the property (typically within 3 days)
- All equity in your home goes to pay off the debt
- Any remaining equity goes to junior lienholders, not you
- You may still owe a deficiency judgment in some cases

**Long-term financial impact:**
- Foreclosure stays on your credit report for 7 years
- Your credit score drops 100-150+ points
- You cannot qualify for a new mortgage for 3-7 years
- Higher interest rates on car loans, credit cards, everything
- Some employers check credit for hiring decisions

**California-specific notes:**
Under California's anti-deficiency laws (CCP 580b and 580d), if your loan was used to purchase the home (purchase money loan), you typically won't owe a deficiency. But if you've refinanced or have a HELOC, you may still be liable for the remaining balance after the sale.

**Compare that to selling before auction:**
- You control the timeline
- You walk away with cash (if you have equity)
- No foreclosure on your record
- You can qualify for a new mortgage in 2 years, not 7
- Your credit takes a smaller hit (or none if we pay off in full)

**This isn't meant to frighten you. It's meant to motivate you.**

You have **{{days_until_auction}} days**. That's enough time to change your outcome completely.

## Email 4: Last Week Decisions - Cash Offer Available

**Send:** Day 7
**Subject Line:** 1 Week Left - Your Cash Offer is Ready
**Preview Text:** We've prepared an offer. Here's what it looks like.

---

Hi {{first_name}},

**{{days_until_auction}} days until auction.**

I've been thinking about your situation, and I want to make this as easy as possible for you.

**We've prepared a preliminary cash offer for your property.**

Based on comparable sales in your area and our standard buying criteria, here's what we're looking at:

**For your property at {{property_address}}:**
- Estimated market value: {{estimated_value}}
- Our typical offer range: 80-90% of market value
- What you could walk away with: {{estimated_net}}

**This is an estimate.** The final number depends on a quick walkthrough of the property. But this gives you a real number to consider.

**What happens next if you say yes:**
1. Today: We schedule a 15-minute walkthrough (can be virtual)
2. Tomorrow: We provide a written cash offer
3. This week: You sign and we open escrow
4. Next week: We close and you get paid

**What happens if you say nothing:**
- {{auction_date}} arrives
- Your home sells on the courthouse steps
- That estimated {{estimated_net}} disappears

**I'm not trying to pressure you.** I'm trying to show you what's actually possible.

**Call me right now:** {{phone_number}}

Or reply to this email with "SEND OFFER" and I'll email you the formal numbers today.

Let's get this done.

P.S. - If you've already found another solution, that's great! Just reply and let me know so I can stop following up. But if you're still figuring this out, please call me. Time is running out.

**CTA:** Call or reply "SEND OFFER"
**Timing Notes:** Day 7 - about 1 week left, provide concrete offer numbers.

## Email 5: Final Options Before Auction

**Send:** Day 10
**Subject Line:** {{days_until_auction}} Days - Final Options
**Preview Text:** This is the last realistic window. Here's what's still possible.

---

{{first_name}},

I'll keep this short because you don't have time for a long email.

**{{days_until_auction}} days until {{auction_date}}.**

**What's still possible:**

**Option 1: Cash sale (3-5 days left to start)**
We can still close before auction, but we need to start TODAY. Call me at {{phone_number}} and we'll move immediately.

**Option 2: Lender postponement**
If you have a legitimate offer in hand, your lender may postpone the auction. I can provide a purchase agreement today that may buy you more time.

**Option 3: Bankruptcy filing**
Filing Chapter 7 or 13 immediately stops the auction through an automatic stay. This has serious long-term consequences, but it's an option. Consult a bankruptcy attorney TODAY if considering this.

**Option 4: Deed in lieu**
Some lenders will accept the deed to the property instead of foreclosing. This avoids the auction but you won't receive any equity. Worth asking if other options fail.

**What's NO longer realistic:**
- Traditional sale with an agent
- Loan modification (process takes too long)
- Waiting to see what happens

**This is my final email before your auction date.**

I genuinely want to help you. But I can only help if you reach out.

**Call me today: {{phone_number}}**

After {{auction_date}}, your options drop to zero. Let's talk while you still have choices.

## Phone Script Integration

When leads from this sequence call or are called, use these talking points:

1. **Acknowledge the stress**: "I know this is an incredibly stressful time. I've helped many homeowners in your exact situation."

2. **Confirm the timeline**: "Let's confirm your auction date so we know exactly how much time we have to work with."

3. **Qualify the opportunity**: "Tell me about your home - when did you buy it, and do you have a sense of what you owe?"

4. **Present the path forward**: "Based on what you've told me, here's what I think we can do..."

5. **Get commitment**: "Can we schedule a quick walkthrough for tomorrow so I can get you a written offer?"
