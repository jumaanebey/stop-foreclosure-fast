Hi {{first_name}},

It's been a week since you downloaded the **{{resource_name}}**, and I wanted to reach out one more time.

**Here's what I know:**

You took the time to download our {{resource_type}}, which tells me you're actively exploring your options. That's a smart first step - getting informed before making decisions.

**Here's what I don't know:**

Your specific situation. And that's where a guide can only take you so far.

---

### The Gap Between Information and Action

The {{resource_type}} gives you general knowledge about:
- {{general_topic_1}}
- {{general_topic_2}}
- {{general_topic_3}}

**But what you really need to know is:**
- What are YOUR specific options?
- What timeline makes sense for YOUR situation?
- What can YOU realistically expect?

That's what a personalized consultation provides.

---

### What Happens in a Consultation

**15-20 minutes that could change everything:**

1. **You share your situation** - Property details, timeline, concerns
2. **We assess your options** - Based on your specific circumstances
3. **You get clear answers** - No jargon, no pressure, just facts
4. **If you want an offer** - We can provide one within 24 hours

The call is free. There's no obligation. And you'll walk away with clarity you can't get from a guide.

**CTA Button:** Schedule Your Free Consultation

**Not Ready to Talk Yet?**

That's completely okay. Keep this email handy - when your situation evolves or you have questions, just hit reply. I'm here whenever you need me.

Wishing you the best,

{{company_name}}
{{phone_number}}

P.S. If something in the {{resource_type}} prompted a specific question, send it over. I'm happy to provide a detailed answer by email if you prefer.
