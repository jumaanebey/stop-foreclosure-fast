## Tax Season Email (February)

**Send Timing:** First week of February

**Subject Line Options:**
- Tax season is here - let's talk about your property
- Important: Tax implications of foreclosure
- Before you file: Consider your property situation

**Preview Text:** What every homeowner facing foreclosure should know about taxes.

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Tax season is upon us, and if you're dealing with a challenging property situation, there are some important things to consider.

**Did you know?** The way you resolve your property situation can have significant tax implications - and acting sooner rather than later may benefit you.

---

### Key Tax Considerations for Homeowners

**If You're Facing Foreclosure:**
- Forgiven mortgage debt may be treated as taxable income
- The timing of a sale vs. foreclosure can affect your tax liability
- You may qualify for exclusions that reduce or eliminate tax consequences
- Consulting with a tax professional before April 15th is important

**If You Sell Before Foreclosure:**
- You may be able to use the primary residence exclusion ($250K/$500K)
- Capital gains treatment is generally more favorable than debt forgiveness income
- You'll have clearer documentation for your tax filings
- A clean sale can simplify your financial picture

---

### Why This Matters Now

If you've been putting off addressing your property situation, tax season is a natural checkpoint. Understanding your options now gives you time to:

1. Consult with a tax professional
2. Make informed decisions about your property
3. Potentially close before the end of tax season if that's advantageous

---

**We're not tax advisors** - but we can give you a clear picture of your options so you can make the best decision with your tax professional.

## Summer / Moving Season Email (June)

**Send Timing:** Early June

**Subject Line Options:**
- Summer is here - perfect time for a fresh start
- Moving season: Your opportunity to start over
- Beat the summer rush - sell fast with no hassle

**Preview Text:** Summer is the best time to make your move.

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

Summer is officially here - and with it, moving season.

If you've been thinking about selling your home and starting fresh, summer offers some unique advantages:

**Why Summer is Ideal for Making Your Move:**

- **Kids are out of school** - If you have children, transitioning over summer means less disruption to their routine
- **Longer days** - More time to handle moving logistics
- **Better weather** - Easier to move belongings and get settled
- **Natural transition point** - Summer has always been a time for new beginnings

---

**What if you could skip the traditional selling hassle?**

With a traditional sale, summer means:
- Constant showings while you're trying to enjoy the season
- Keeping your home "show-ready" during family time
- Waiting 30-60 days for buyer financing
- Uncertainty about whether deals will fall through

**With us, summer means:**
- One simple walkthrough - no showings
- Cash offer within 24 hours
- Close in 7 days (or whenever works for you)
- Spend your summer focused on your next chapter

---

If you've been putting off dealing with your property situation, let summer be your season of change.
