Hi {{first_name}},

I hope you've had a chance to review the information I sent over about your property at {{property_address}}.

I wanted to check in and see if you have any questions about our cash offer or the process. Sometimes things come up after a few days of thinking it over, and I want to make sure you have all the clarity you need.

**Common Questions Homeowners Ask:**

**"How do you determine the offer amount?"**
We look at recent comparable sales, property condition, and current market trends to arrive at a fair price.

**"Are there really no fees?"**
Correct. We cover all closing costs. The offer we make is the amount you receive.

**"How fast can we actually close?"**
We can close in as few as {{fastest_close_days}} days, or on your timeline if you need more time.

**"What if I change my mind?"**
There's no obligation until you sign final closing documents. You're in control.

Is there anything else I can clarify for you?
