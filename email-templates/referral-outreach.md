## Tips for Outreach Success

1. **Personalize each email** - Mention something specific about their practice or a recent case (if public)

2. **Follow up 2-3 times** - Most responses come from follow-ups, not initial outreach

3. **Offer value first** - Share helpful resources before asking for referrals

4. **Be patient** - Building referral relationships takes time

5. **Track your outreach** - Use a simple spreadsheet to track who you've contacted and when

6. **Ask for introductions** - When you get one attorney relationship, ask if they know colleagues who might benefit

7. **Provide excellent service** - One successful referral leads to many more

- **Week 1-2:** Send initial emails to 20-30 professionals
- **Week 3:** Follow up with non-responders
