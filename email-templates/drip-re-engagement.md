**Send Timing:** Day 1 of re-engagement sequence

**Subject Line:** Still thinking about your options, {{first_name}}?

**Preview Text:** We're still here to help when you're ready.

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

It's been a little while since we last connected about your property at {{property_address}}, and I wanted to reach out.

I understand that selling your home is a major decision, and sometimes life gets busy or circumstances change. That's completely normal.

If you're still exploring your options, I'm here to help with no pressure or obligation. Things in the market may have shifted since we last spoke, and there might be new possibilities worth considering.

Would you be open to a quick 10-minute call this week to discuss where things stand?

## Email 2: Things May Have Changed - Quick Update

**Send Timing:** Day 7

**Subject Line:** Quick update on options for {{property_address}}

**Preview Text:** Market conditions have shifted - here's what it means for you.

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share a brief update that might be relevant to your situation.

Since we last spoke, we've been actively helping homeowners in {{city}} navigate their options. Market conditions continue to evolve, and what we could offer previously may have changed.

Here's what I want you to know:

- **No waiting for bank approvals** - We work on your timeline
- **No repairs needed** - We buy properties as-is
- **No hidden fees** - What we offer is what you get
- **Flexible closing dates** - Move when it works for you

If your circumstances have changed, or if you'd simply like to know what options are available now, I'm happy to provide an updated, no-obligation assessment.

**CTA Button:** Get an Updated Offer

No pressure either way. Just want to make sure you have the information you need.

Warm regards,

## Email 3: Last Check-In (Breakup Email)

**Send Timing:** Day 14

**Subject Line:** Should I close your file, {{first_name}}?

**Preview Text:** Just checking if you'd still like to hear from us.

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a couple of times about your property at {{property_address}}, and I haven't heard back. I completely understand - you're busy, and this may not be the right time.

I don't want to keep filling your inbox if you've moved on or found another solution. So I wanted to ask directly:

**Should I close your file?**

If you're no longer interested in exploring a sale, just let me know and I'll make sure you don't receive any more messages from us.

But if you're still considering your options - even if it's not for a few months - I'm happy to stay in touch and be a resource when you're ready.

A simple reply either way would be greatly appreciated.

**CTA Button:** Yes, Keep Me Updated

Thank you for your time,
