## Email 3: Title Process Explained

**Send Timing:** Day 3

**Subject Line:** Behind the scenes: What's happening with your title

**Preview Text:** Understanding the title process (so you don't have to stress).

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

You might be wondering what's happening behind the scenes right now. Let me pull back the curtain on the title process.

**What Is a Title Search?**

A title search is a review of public records to confirm:
- You are the legal owner of the property
- There are no outstanding liens or claims
- The title can be transferred cleanly to us

**Why Does This Matter?**

This protects both of us. It ensures you can sell the property free and clear, and that there won't be any surprises after closing.

**Current Status:**
Our title company is actively processing your file. If any issues arise (which is rare), we'll contact you immediately with solutions.

**What You Need to Do:**
Nothing at this point. Just keep an eye on your phone in case we need to verify any information.

**Questions?** Your closing coordinator {{coordinator_name}} is available at {{coordinator_phone}}.

**CTA Button:** Contact My Closing Coordinator
