## 3-Email Sequence for Past Clients (30-60-90 Days Post-Close)

## Email 1: Thank You + Soft Referral Ask

**Send Timing:** 30 days after closing

**Subject Line Options:**
- Checking in, {{first_name}} - how's the fresh start?
- One month later - hope you're doing well
- Quick check-in from {{sender_name}}

**Preview Text:** Just wanted to see how you're doing after the sale.

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I hope this email finds you well! It's been about a month since we closed on {{property_address}}, and I wanted to check in.

I've been thinking about you and hoping that the weight has lifted. Dealing with {{their_situation_brief}} is never easy, and I'm glad we could help make that transition smoother.

**A few quick questions (no need to reply to all - just curious):**
- Have you settled into your new situation?
- Did everything go smoothly after closing?
- Is there anything we could have done better?

Your feedback genuinely helps us serve future clients better.

---

One more thing - if you ever come across a friend, family member, or colleague who's facing a similar situation, I hope you'll think of us.

We know how hard it can be to find someone trustworthy when you're dealing with property stress, and a personal recommendation means the world - both to us and to the person who needs help.

No pressure at all. Just wanted you to know we're always here.

Wishing you all the best,

P.S. If you haven't already, we'd be honored if you'd share your experience in a quick Google review. It helps other homeowners find us when they need help. [Leave a Review]({{google_review_link}})

## Email 2: Direct Referral Request With Incentive

**Send Timing:** 60 days after closing

**Subject Line Options:**
- A quick favor to ask, {{first_name}}
- Know anyone who needs help with their home?
- Your experience could help someone else

**Preview Text:** We have a small way to say thank you for referrals.

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I hope the past couple of months have been good to you. I wanted to reach out with a quick favor to ask.

**Do you know anyone who might need our help?**

We're talking about people facing situations like:
- Falling behind on mortgage payments
- Received a foreclosure notice or NOD
- Going through a divorce and need to sell fast
- Inherited a property they can't keep
- Dealing with a property that needs too many repairs
- Any situation where a quick, hassle-free sale would help

---

**Here's why I'm asking:**

Most of our clients come to us through word of mouth - people like you who had a good experience and shared it with someone in need. It's the best compliment we can receive.

**And we want to say thank you properly.**

For every referral who closes with us, we'll send you a **${{referral_amount}} thank-you gift** - no strings attached. It's just our way of showing appreciation for your trust.

---

**How to refer someone:**

Simply reply to this email with their name and phone number (or have them mention your name when they call us). We'll take it from there - with the same care and professionalism you experienced.

**CTA Button:** Refer Someone Now

Or forward this email to anyone you think could benefit.

Warmly,

{{sender_name}}
{{company_name}}
{{phone_number}}

P.S. Quick reminder: We help homeowners throughout California. So even if your friend or family member is in a different city, we can still help.
